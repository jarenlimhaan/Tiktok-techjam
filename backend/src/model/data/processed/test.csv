"Awful. Awful. Awful. The receptionist barely looks up when you enter. The ""massage therapist"" (quotes because I doubt she even went to school) Lina had long nails and scratched my neck, both painful and still present the day after. She wasn't fluid in her motions whatsoever. She barely listened to a word of request. I said ""I don't want to do anything else, I'd like to just work on my neck and my left shoulder."" Next thing I know she's at my feet and I had to redirect her several times. Even then, her skill was completely lacking and I left feeling worse than I did going in. She said ""okay you feel good"" and walked out. No! I felt terrible and my scratches hurt. She's abrupt, doesn't listen, and actually causes injury. Melissa the person who did the facial was WONDERFUL and I was really thinking that the place was looking up after seeing her. Excellent, excellent. The woman who did my nails. I don't remember her name, but she was also harsh and abrupt. She asked where my friend and I worked and when we told her she proceeded for the ENTIRE duration of our pedicures to tell us how much she despises our place of employment and the job that we do. Despite our frequent attempts to redirect the conversation and apologize and explain to her why her small cut on her finger was not seen in the Emergency Department before a major trauma, she continued to bash our work. It was miserable. Miserable place, miserable people. Don't waste your time, there are so many better places with better people and better quality service for half the price!!!",Rant,2
Easy place to get too. The meals are price reasonable. The only fault was there were a lot of dirty tables,Rant,2
"I eat at Pina's or take-out about once a month. My favorites includes their dinner specials, cheesesteaks, calzones, and seafood dishes. The shrimp scampi appetizer (sans linguini) and steamed clams are excellent inexpensive. Service is always flawless. For casual dining this place is very good.",Rant,2
I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.,Rant,2
"I had my condo tented a few weeks ago. We came home 2 days later to find dog poop was shoved in the cracks of the floor rocks in the back yard. The whole back yard smelled horrible!! We collect our dog poop for a week and put it in a bucket until trash day, we also add a little dirt to the bucket to keep the smell down. We forgot to through it out before the tenting and left the full bucket in the yard. I called Jhonny's and asked for someone to come out and explain why they did this and clean it up. Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied, saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket. I told Jhonny's employee it was to much of a coincidence that the bucket of poop was entirely empty and the area where they had to add dirt smelled of poop. The employee continued to lie about where he got the dirt from, but agreed to have someone come by the following Monday and/or someone from there office would call me to set up an appt. As of today no one called, no one showed up.",Rant,2
"Thought we would try this place out for a quick bite with the kids. The food was terrible, even the kids burger which was about half the size of the bun (didn't think you could mess up a kid burger). I had the crab cake pasta which was bland and full of crab shells. My husband had the white beans which were not yo momma's for sure.",Rant,2

"I eat mostly vegetarian and was super psyched to go to Blue Sage at its new location - as I had tried to frequent the old location every year when I came home for the holidays. It's still a great atmosphere and excellent wait staff, but the acoustics in the one large room off to the right when you enter are pretty terrible. I was there with my older father, who is hard of hearing, and we had to be moved to another location so we could hear each other talk. I would recommend asking not to be in that room when making a reservation. Also, during this most recent visit I found the food to be more bland than I remembered.",Rant,2
"Guy at the counter was rude, the place was filthy, and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all!",Rant,2
"The food is OK, but is ruined by the awful atmosphere. Two of the employees calling each other ""faggots"" and the deafening rap music with every other word being ""motherf****r"" made it seem that they wanted customers to leave. Order carryout or eat outside, but eating inside is a miserable experience. Note to employees"" Keep your homophobic slurs to where customers aren't able to hear them.",Rant,2
"We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious , I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space.",Rant,2

"I actually think the beignet here were better than Cafe Du Monde. They were lighter and fluffier. However, they were also WAAAAY bigger. I'm fairly certain that one person should never eat three beignet at a sitting anyway, but the idea of eating three of these gives me sugar shock. We split an order, and I still couldn't finish. That's not really a complaint, though. Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends. Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat. The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz. The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation. I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment). I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere. It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening. Other than the beignet, the food was fine. It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy. My bread was a little stale - it happens. It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out. I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes. Overall, I had a great evening, and I would go back.",Rant,2
"This location used to be good, several years ago. About 3 years ago it started to go downhill and now it is just terrible. There were 2 people working on a Saturday evening. Nearly all the tables were full and there were people waiting to order and to pay. The sandwich that was made for me was on hard bread, burnt and barely edible. They need to either shape up or ship out.",Rant,2
"Disgusting food. We didn't like any of the items we ordered. We ordered the fried pickles and they tasted OLD. I wonder if they just reheated old fried pickles because yuck, I've never tasted such gross fried pickles before. The burger was greasy and a mess and just all around not tasty at all. I don't normally give bad reviews, but they need to improve the quality of their food. We left without finishing our food because it was so bad, and the manager didn't charge us for it. We still left a tip though :)",Rant,2
"In a nutshell: These guys are awesome to deal with. They came on time; They worked their butts off until the job was done; They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price. The Details: When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field. I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around. The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end. I knew what I wanted. I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work. Someone who cared about customer satisfaction. Someone I could trust. I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort. When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing. I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo . This will be great, I thought. Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money. Right? Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video. So I kept calling around. Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort. He was great! He said ""Sure, we'll have a look at the video"", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system. I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology. Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic. They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system. When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot. I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options. Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me. He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales. No lies about pricing. Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician. I loved that. We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty. I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the ""quite"" part. Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off. At the end of the day, we got a new ""Green"" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone. All for a very reasonable price. Very cool. Literally! (My daughter's comment about this review: ""Why don't you write a book"".)",Ad,0
"We have been here 3 times and enjoyed great, friendly service on each occasion. The buffet area is clean. The waiters are very helpful and quick to collect the dishes from the table and bring water/drinks. One of the times we came the bathroom was pretty dirty, that's the only minus. I really liked the pulled pork in BBQ sauce with chips, although I think they only have it during lunch on weekdays. Also... banana pudding! Ha ha, it'd been a while! They also have ice creams in many flavors. One time we came the waitress kept practicing her Spanish with my mom, who speaks very little English. Pretty cool!",Rant,2
I am only giving 3 stars because of the service. The food was great and the drinks were reasonably priced. Our waitress was horrible. Disappeared for long stretches. When she dropped out check off she didn't even make eye contact with me. The table next to us even commented on her attitude.,Rant,2

The toilets were very dirty; other than that the food was good.,Rant,2
Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways.

"Pretty good americanized Italian. The food is ok, but $12 for a plate of spagetti with meat sauce? Considering I can go across the street and eat better Italian for comparable money? Oh and the beef ribs are terrible. Pork ribs are excellent. Strange. The salad bar was ok but way more expensive than I'd consider reasonable.",Rant,2
"Elm Cafe serves the best sandwiches in the city. Actually, if I were ranking my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever, items from Elm Cafe would make the list several times. Their creative combinations of flavours using impeccably fresh ingredients have, on numerous occasions, left me almost dizzy with delight after partaking of such savoriness and oomph. The only downsides to Elm are the space itself (serious lacking in elbow room) and the attitudes of the staff (seriously lacking in tact and general courtesy). I probably would go to Elm more often, but I don't particularly want to have to endure a long wait only to endure bad hipster attitudes. But the sandwiches are outstanding. Really, truly outstanding.",Rant,2
"Well my boyfriend and I gave Cheddars a second chance recently, because the time before we had awful service. The food has always been pretty good and that's why we choose to go back. We had great service this time and the drinks and food were great!! The only complaint I would have is that we ordered an appetizer and barely had the chance to eat any of it before our dinner came out. We were still charged for the appetizer. All and all its reasonable and family friendly place to go!",Rant,2

"My partner and I had the worst restaurant experience ever at this newly opened Chinese restaurant in IV right by Giovannis. We understand that they are new but the service was terrible and the food very decent. We came in at 9pm when there were 3 other tables around us. First of all as we walked in the waitress told us they ran out of rice ( What kind of asian place runs out of rice?) and that we could eat the food with noodles instead. So we said okay we can do that, we ordered a szechuan eggplant for $6.99 and a large boba milk tea for $2.29, all the sudden our total was $16.00 and we were very confused by that. Also, my friend was waiting in line to order but the waitress let a whole group of people cut in front of her to pay for their food (they ate and paid later I guess). It was taking too long, she wasn't going to be able to eat with us at the same time so she just decided not to order. We noticed there was a plate of noodles sitting out little before we ordered on the servers desk, it was sitting for like 8 minutes. While we were sitting they grabbed that chow mein noodles and gave it to us served with a spoon!!! Who eats noodles with a spoon?? We had to ask them for chopsticks. We also did not receive any water!!! They have bottles of dark vinegar and soy sauce without labels and without knowing my partner used vinegar and so it ruined part of our noodles. The chow mein was very decent. It only had like cabbage and pieces of carrot. We did not get our boba for a long time so we told them we ordered a large boba, when they brought out the boba it was NOT a large!!! It was a regular size drink or a talle at starbucks! And the waitress told us yes that's a large. And THEN handed us a receipt for a REGULAR size boba!! We were so confused we told the waittress we paid for the boba, but she said oh no I didn't include it in your order. WTF. Two waitresses were serving us and none of them knew what the hell they were doing. The boba was the worse boba I've had, it was like water with boba that had been sitting out, the boba was lumpy and wasn't chewy, it just crumbled to thick pieces!! We figured out that they must've charged us like 8$ for a big order of super plain chow mein! We thought they were just going to substitute noodles with rice! Then they told us we have rice now do you want some? (They should have told us they were cooking rice!) By that time we did get our eggplant which tasted decent, looked nice and smelled good. But I think that they use MSG often in their ingredients. The waitress came with two bowls of mushy rice, by that time we were so fed up we told her we will just take it all to go. She said okay, and took the rice to give to other people!! So we did not get any rice (which was said to be free with entrees) in our to go box. TERRIBLE SERVICE. The food looked like it can actually be good, but it wasn't great. I would not go here to risk the terrible service again.",Rant,2
"I love the recliners. They are very comfortable, however it's a bit gross when you have to clean up other people's trash and tissues before sitting. Before the movie started I saw the employee go in with a dust pan but not sure what he did. The floor was full of popcorn and trash, the cup holders were wet and contained trash, the seats had tissues and napkins stuffed in the seats. The lobby was even dirty as was the bathroom. It was a big trade off for reclining seats.",Rant,2
"Nice! Perpetual coffee refills, a good medium to dark roast. A dish of half-n-half arrives with the coffee, you don't have to ask for it. That's nothing, there's 2 kinds of hot sauce (including Verde).on the table, extinguishing the boring need to ask and wait for them as in most other breakfast places. But what I liked best was the ""build your own breakfast"" of any 4 items for $5-something. I chose: (1) coffee, (2) two eggs, (3) hash browns and toast, and (4) sausage patty. Pairing-up hash browns And toast as one selection, was an act of Jerry Bob genius. Yes, at $2.09 per cup, the overall price of a meal goes down if you make it one of the four items rather than have it separately. Ladyfriend had tomatoes as one of her items, and got a nice 4 or 5 good-sized slices and was just about thrilled. I'm not one of those awful folks who go to these places just to chat endlessly with the poor waitresses, and if I was, I'd be disappointed here, for they're just too busy for chit chat, yet maintain a good esprit de corp. This is SO much better service then I was used to getting at the late, defunct Denny's on Speedway, and quieter by far than the jarring, hectic ambience at Jerry-Bob's on Speedway at Pantano. This may be MY breakfast spot for awhile, and hope you try it, too!",Rant,2
"Well, to start the dining area is very very dark. We sat at the sushi bar and our table was dirty and sticky. Next we ordered. I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected..",Rant,2

"I've been going to Public House for years(?!) and the main reason is because I keep winning those darn Free Happy Hours. The layout of the bar is awful....it is almost always packed and just about every day you will find a special group has an entire section ""reserved"", making matters worse. There are a couple of really good, reliable bartenders (like Christina). I've never been cheated out of a drink and they always taste better at half price! The food is actually pretty good: Nachos, wings..used to love the Public House burger and then they jacked up the price! The atmosphere (why is it always so dark??) makes me only give it 3 stars. I'd rather not get into how shady it gets when it becomes a ""club"" with a line at the door...laughable!",Rant,2
Honestly haven't left a place more disappointed in my life. The service was terrible from the start. The servers were very rude and extremely slow. It almost seemed like they were all extremely hungover or just stupid. After waiting for 15 minutes with absolutely no service we ended up walking out. I hear the beer is good though.,Rant,2
"WORST location out there. I eat Chipotle 4+ times a week, and every time I go to this location I have a terrible experience. Today, my burrito (with almost no meat put in) tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it. He then tried to rewrap it and failed. It came apart again on the third try... as well as the fourth. When the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots, he still wrapped and gave it to me. Also, have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries. Like I said, I eat Chipotle 4-5 times a week, but I'll be going to Qdoba after this.",Rant,2
"One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings. We were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables. Needless to say, I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food.",Rant,2
"As a foodie I don't feel as though an establishment has to suffer a poor rating based on service. So .. As far as food is concerned I ordered the Garlic Chicken with Rosemary .. It was fantastic . The Duck Spring Rolls were delicious . My friend ordered the highly recommended BBQ shrimp which were phenomenal,even after the shrimp were finished we kept dipping the French bread in the sauce . Downside : we waited an hour for food and about a half hour for a table which is ok I guess were not impatient THE PROBLEM . Our server ALTON took our order and never said anything else to us for the remainder of the night .. It was weird and awkward .. He never checked on us .. He never gave us any food updates .. He didn't even ask us ""how was everything?"" ""Would you like dessert"" there was a waiter who wasn't even our waiter who put the BBQ shrimp bib on my friend . We paid and talked to the manager . Sorry ALTON this was easily the worst service I ever had so .. Takes nothing away from the food . Only the dining experience",Rant,2
"Well against my better judgement I went back to Freedom Smoke... I was in a bind and needed a tank so I called them first to find out if they had what I was after. Brandon answered the phone and I explained that I wanted a Pro Tank because I had broken the threads off the base. He said he had some in stock, I then asked what the wait was like. He said they were pretty slow so I pressed on and asked if he thought I could get my tank and some juice in about fifteen minutes, he said more like ten. I was less than a mile away and when I pulled in it was more like 20 minutes just to get my order placed and another ten for my juice to come out. OMG!!! The only good thing to come out of this was they had the tank. The wait was ridiculous and to top it off the Starblast e juice was AWFUL!!!! Will I finally learn???",Rant,2

"WARNING: HORRIBLE! I absolutely love BBQ and southern food. With that said my family and I decide to try this place for take out since it was brand new. First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. Never the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had.

Can't say I'd return even without a wait, though; would prefer to just buy a jar of the syrup and apply it at home. Ended up at $24.43 pre-tip; no paper towels in the restroom and the day had barely started, so that was probably a dogshow.",Rant,2
Very disappointed in them. I made an appointment to have an alignment on my vehicle a week in advance when I made the appointment he said he would get it right in at 8:00 in the morning. At 9:30 I went to check on it. They hadn't even touched. Don't make promises you can't keep. When you know you can't keep the promise let the customer know with a phone call. They never offered a substitute to fix a problem that was not mine. He apologized but then said it wasn't their fault. Well the truth is it is. You are the business you should own when mistakes are made. I am the customer and that does not put faith in the situation for me. I also explained in the morning I need my vehicle back at a certain time. To make sure and remind of the situation at hand. This is terrible service. Would not recommend them do anyone.,Rant,2
"Terrible seating experience. We walked into the restaurant. Half the tables were empty (not exaggerating, I counted). The host said ""we are too busy, 35 minute wait"". We put our name down for optionality, and not 7 minutes later we were texted that our table was ready. We arrived at the restaurant and were made to wait another 10 minutes because the host was ""busy"".",Rant,2
"I wasn't really impressed. When I got to the counter, the cashier barely even looked at me. I had to ask him if he was ready for my order. I ran next door to pick up the take out dinner I had order while my donuts were being prepared and they almost didn't let me back in because they were closing and thought I was a new customer. The donuts were good and I appreciate them being fresh but waiting for each one to be made makes for a long wait. Plus, they are all the same base. No chocolate donut or cream filled, etc. I'd probably just go to Dunkin next time for the variety and speed.",Rant,2
"Gave Gusto Osteria a second try. First experience was awful, especially the long wait to get our food from the kitchen. This time we decided we will not be in a hurry to come back and give it a third try. Foo foo phooey Italian food and too expense with poor value. Cute hostess that greeted us was very friendly, held the door, and seated us immediately. The service was excellent this time... our dinners came out of the kitchen quickly (although the restaurant was pretty empty except for a large party of 40 for a private affair dining on the patio), our server Jordan was attentive, and the busboy had a great sense of humor and constantly came by to check on us and refill our water glasses, BUT the Alfredo sauce was the worst we've ever had (very disappointing) and the although the homemade sausage was plentiful, just okay if you like Italian sausage (not too spicy... though we would not get it again with Fettuccine Alfredo). The Cannelloni with chicken had a better tasting sauce, very different for an entree. BUT overall, the prices on this menu are too high for a la carte or a weekday dinner, and we ordered the least expensive pasta entrees. Not a vegetable or a small dinner salad are served with the entrees. No linquini with clam sauce or spaghetti with meatballs, no lasagna, no traditional Italian dishes, and most prices are $15 and up, up, up. Olive Garden is a much better value with a larger selection of entrees and all the soup or salad you can eat, or even Zona 78 nearby is better (that is probably why they were packed and there was a 45 minute wait for a table). And the hot bread we were served when we first sat down was just plain weird.... nothing special. The chef came out of the kitchen to visit with a celebrity diner (Jim Click) for a long time, and when he passed us (the only other diners in the restaurant in that area) on his way back to the kitchen, he did not even acknowledge us, or say hello, or ask if every thing was okay. Kind of rude.",Rant,2
"This is awful. The beds are so bad my arm fell asleep every night and my hip is killing me from laying on my side! The floors need replaced and we had to ask 3 times for towels because apparently they don't follow Their own rule of where to leave towels to use them again. Then they took them and left half as many as they took! The front desk clerk was soooo lazy he was playing video games and you could barely get his attention. The vending machine was broken. The shower head was so so. I had to put it on ""massage just to rinse my hair but at least I had the option. The noise from 65 is so loud trucks were waking me up. Never will I return here. My husband is moving to another hotel tomorrow just a block away. He is willing to pay more but he doesn't have to!!! I would give negative stars if I could.",Rant,2
"The ambiance and live music here is fantastic. The band was pleasant and not overbearingly loud. However the whole ""you have to be out in 1.5 hours"" is a major turn off. I could understand if people were sitting around not ordering but if you're ordering food and drink that makes no sense. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food. Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on, she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point. The tacos still took another 15 min after that. Also they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing. I went there based on one menu and got something different. Annoying.",Rant,2
Was here about a month ago. The food here is great but the waitress we had was terrible. She stood at the bar...saw every move we made and did nothing. We waited for our appetizer....waited for our main course.... waited for her to notice we were done. Then it was like she was doing the world a favor by waiting on us. I had been here several times. I left her no tip. The stars for the food.... no stars for her.,Rant,2

"Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed, so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving. Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away.",Rant,2
"Greenwood is not as ritzy as Metairie Cemetery but worth a visit (yes, I have ancestors here, too). It is convenient that it is right near the end of the Canal Streetcar line and they have the Holy Grounds coffee place nearby and Holt and a couple of other cemeteries are there as well. What I really like about Greenwood is that they have an excellent website. If you do or think you do have ancestors buried there, go to www.greenwoodnola.com. I wish every cemetery had such a great website. It even has pictures. If it weren't for the website, I wouldn't have known that my grandmother's older sister that died as a young child was in the tomb of her grandparents rather than her parents, since her name is not on the tombstone. I had never even thought to wonder why her name wasn't on the Mayne tomb, anyway, because she died so very long ago. Maybe I need to find which Flanagan cousin is responsible for that tomb and see if we can get her name and dates inscribed.",Ad,0
"My boyfriend picked up a taco pizza from here and brought it home. I'd never had one before but the pictures looked okay. MOST disgusting thing I've ever had. He said they used to be much different and delicious and it has totally gone downhill. It was dry, crusty and hard cheese, no sauce, tasted like a piece of bread with lettuce and tomatoes on it. I swear I think they grabbed a 2-day old cheese pizza and threw some taco meat, lettuce and tomatoes on it and re-heated it in the microwave. I'll never be back, not for taco pizza, not for regular pizza. Yuck.",Rant,2

"Alrighty. I live right next to this place and decided to grab something to eat for lunch there because I felt obligated after being here for half a year just about and I must say that it left so many things to be desired. First off I noticed the hours are just weird. There is no rhythm of reason for the shifting of hours that they do. We'll be open normal hours on Tuesday/Wednesday, but screw around and put Thursday on a totally different time!? To me that makes 0 since, but I'm sure they have reasons. Secondly, I love to eat whatever and have the God given ability to do as so without gaining any weight. I actually lose weight the older I get. That being said, I don't see how over half of your menu is fried food. I felt like I was working for FEMA again and in some hole in the wall truck stuff where that was my only option. I wanted a lunch portion and my only option felt like it was fried. Finally has to be the customer service. When I ask what does your ""fully dressed"" come with. Don't say lettuce, tomatoes, and things like that. Everyone does it different. I am not cool with just taking the lettuce and tomatoes off and sticking with the ""stuff like that"" option. I know I can ball park it, but is that mayo? Is it mustard? Do you have something crazy that is unique that you put on there? Sorry I don't go there all the time and have it detailed out. As for the good traits that earned this place an average review. I did appreciate that my ""large"" beer, was actually a huge beer. It was actually a challenge to drink it. The glass was awkward, but all in all it was a hefty challenge for a lunch beer. I also like the old diner look. When I was growing up, my family would always go to places with this look and it was a warm setting. I would go back and try some of their other options besides fried seafood. Even though they said they add a 18% grat on your ticket, they didn't on mine. That saved them from getting a terrible review as well. All in all, I would go back to this place, but it would have to be for diner. I would love to feel nauseated over their batter again, but I think I'm going to have to back off this time.",Rant,2
"Terrible customer service! Nice, beautiful Sunday afternoon, we wanted to sit outside, have a drink and eat a late lunch. The hostess took us to our table which was in the sun (all the other tables were under the pavilion in the shade) and there was a table with young kids right next to this table. We wanted a nice quiet lunch to ourselves since it was a day without kids for us. We asked to sit on the other side where it was quieter and it was in the shade. We were told we could not sit there because there was no server there. I asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no. We went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didn't know who the manager would be that we need to talk to. We were so excited when we walked up because it was the perfect atmosphere on the perfect day to be outside. Needless to say we did not stay and will never go back.",Rant,2
"Service was fine (other than our dirty appetizer plates sitting stacked at the end of the table throughout our meal) - Had the mac and cheese appetizer arrived before we placed our order, we probably would have left - Mac and cheese had odd plastic-y taste - Crab cake was bland - seared tuna should have come on a smaller plate (three slices of tuna on top of rice on one side of a rectangular plate) - we ordered a chicken soup to go and had to throw it out when we arrived at our destination because the cardboard cover had popped off the hot cup - pear crisp was the best part - $4 cup of coffee was tepid, at best",Rant,2

DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THE WORST GO TO MASSAGE ENVY IN MT LAUREL OR CHERRY HILL AND BE TREATED RIGHT Hand & Stone is a money hungry thieving deceptive company. I had the worst massage at the Marlton location then as I went to pay with a Gift card that was given to me as a gift I was told by the rude receptionist that I had to pay $11.00 because my card had expired. SO I RECEIVED A TERRIBLE MASSAGE AND WAS RIPPED OFF FOR $ 11.00. I filled out a bad survey online then received a nasty email from the Manage her name is Jessika Morrow SHE WAS THE WORST I guess she feels it's ok to talk to customers like crap has horrible manager skills and should not have this position. when I said I would leave feedback as the worst place and massage I have ever had her response was I DON'T CARE DO WHAT YOU WANT... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS The worst. I then called the Corporate Office and asked to speak to the Owners of the Franchise there names are Steve and Fred Vaccaro needless to say after leaving 3 messages for them to call me about this terrible situation they could have cared less to have called me to listen to my concerns.

"I will never go back there again. I decided last minute to get a silkwrap instead of just a manicure. I'm not really a nail person, I get my nails done maybe once a month. I tried to explain to her how I wanted them done, which was kind of hard because of the language barrier. I don't like the fake plastic tip because they damage your real nail. I watched several Youtube videos on how a silkwrap was a better alternative. Anyway because I wanted a little length to my nails she was going to use the plastic tips. I told her no, and I explained to her why. She said so you want to use your own nail, I said yes. Long story short and $35 later I have a regular manicure. When I saw how short she was filing the nail (which was my own nails length), I asked her what she was doing. She stated this is how its done and there was nothing else she could do since I didn't want the tips. So even though I was unsatisfied with her service I tip her anyway. I guess she was unhappy with the tip and after she finished painting my nails, she had me dry them using the mini fan at her station. Normally they take you to the drying station. And I was supposed to receive another service, but she started work on someone else. By this time I'm livid; I grab my things and left. I was able to find another place to get my eye brows done (Brown Spa; which they did an excellent job and was very polite). I asked the tech about silkwraps and she confirmed what I though. She also told me she never goes to Tip Top Nails ""they're terrible"". I was able to find the Youtube video, so I went back to Tip Top Nails and show it to her. She said they don't do it like that, and that if I showed her the video before she would have told me no. They refused to do my nails the way I wanted them, and refused to give me a refund. I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get many days to myself, and it pisses me off that this chick messed up my day. Save yourself some money and go to a different salon. The Tip Top Nail Salon in the Galleria Mall (Brentwood, MO) is so much better.",Rant,2

I had the carne asada, was cooked very well but sauce was bland as well as the rice, mom had a steak dish that had way to much cumin in it, horrible overwhelming spice that was all you could taste.

"Our server was awesome. Very tentative and extremely nice! That is the only thing saving this place plus the maple wings were delicious. Now for the bad part. We paid 35 dollars for the ""piano guys"" to sing a song to the birthday girl. We had 3 options of songs that we wanted to hear. They called our birthday girl on stage and began to sing a rendition of Aladins whole new world. (Which was not one of the songs we had picked) The song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. The piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs,tying her up, filling holes, splurging on her face, and cumming in her hair. It was even worse than that. Her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn't hear to well because the sound system is terrible. Our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. It was disgusting, offensive, and embarrassing. Trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. It completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. We spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. Also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang part of.",Rant,2
"Place is okay. They were the only restaurant that was able to accommodate a large party on such short notice. I ordered the black spaghetti that other patrons raved about. It was pretty disgusting. I'm not sure why he had some a weird texture and almost tasted like plastic. I've tried many different types of spaghetti and this by far was the worst plate I've tried. My co-workers said their food was okay though. Maybe it was just what I ordered that sucked. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I'd give them another go. The drinks were on point as expected.",Rant,2

"Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend. We went to four places. The first business was a glorified coffee shop. No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie. Although delicious, it was not a cupcake or macaroon. The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor, so when it was my turn, the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful, they should have paid me to try their sample. It was a vegan bakery free of gluten, dairy, nut, soy, egg and any other allergen one can think of. I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them, but I'm not sure why this establishment was included. How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients? The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons. We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake. How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh? It was still partially frozen in the center! Luckily, it was a beautiful day to be outside, because this tour left a lot to be desired.",Rant,2
"This review is for the bar inside of The Saint Hotel. I went there yesterday with a girlfriend to order a drink while waiting on a friend. The bartender (Megan) was rude, unprofessional, and unpleasant. My friend ordered a French 45 and I ordered one of the ""Favorites"" the Pimm's Cup. We both disliked our drinks very much. I'm not sure what went wrong, but they just weren't very good. We let Megan know that we disliked the drinks and she says ""what's wrong them?"" We tell her that they both just taste bad. She then says ""well I made them the exact way the menu says"" Then she sticks a straw in one of the drinks and says ""that taste like it's suppose to"" Then she says ""since I already made the drinks, you'll have to pay for them"" This is completely unacceptable and poor customer service. If a guest orders anything that they dislike, the right thing to do is ask what would they like instead. I work in the restaurant industry and so does my friend who was with me. So we know true hospitality and what Megan said was the opposite. I ask to speak with the manager. Megan tells me that the manager isn't in until 5pm (it's almost 2pm at this point) Megan then says, ""I've worked here for 6 years so I know what I'm doing and what I'm talking about"" I then ask for the hotel manager. Megan says ""I'll get you something else and you just pay for the original two drinks that you disliked. Why on earth would we pay for the original two drinks in lieu of new ones? Why wouldn't she just comp the drinks, or void them, or separate them off for the manager to come later on? So I ask her those questions and she says she didn't have the authority to comp or void anything. Needless to say, we paid and left. But how horrible and rude of Megan to argue with us as guest, then tell us we have to pay for something that we disliked?! What rude service all for two drinks!",Rant,2
Let me start by first saying there are many better dinning options in the area. I have visited this place 5 times and only ate there twice. It's best to have reservations due to almost an hour wait times from 5-8 Even if they have many open tables open and clean they will not seat you without at least a 30minute wait and It's best to have a party of more than 2 so as to avoid getting stuck in the extremely crowded and loud area of the bar or by the kitchen in a cramped booth and so that the waitresses will pay enough attention to you and get your order in within an hour. Despite them having almost the worst service of almost any place Ive been to the food is very good but overpriced and small portioned for some dishes.,Rant,2
I loved the idea of dinner with a movie and the people here r really nice. There's nothing bad about this place EXCEPT the terrible sound. The sound in this theater is so quiet u can hear ur neighbors eating their food... Wish the sound was better. The prices r reasonable and worth it cuz movie theater food is normally expensive anyway. Other than the sound this cinema is definitely worth coming to atleast for a try. Overall it was a really fun experience :-),Rant,2

"Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed, and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events. Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost, which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and ""after-hours"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue, even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically, they set up the tents on Friday, left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday, and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back, I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup, even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing, I had to file a claim with my credit card company. It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (""scam"" is the correct word), and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner, they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved.",Rant,2
"I walked down to the Royal Sonesta and went to Desire Oyster Bar. The place was packed! I took it a sign of being good, but wrong! It was not. I was very disappointed with my meal. I ordered char-grilled oysters ($9.95) which looked good but were soooo salty they were barely edible. The oyster were teeny and they also were gritty. Yuck, just awful. Then I ordered fried green tomatoes ($8), and they were deep fried...which I normally love...but...No taste but oil and the sauce they served with it tasted like vinegar. Then crab cakes ($11.95). They looked good, had lots of crab but were also deep fried! Taste was not good, I only ate one. Even, the drink I ordered, my first Ramos Gin Fizz ($8) was not good. It tasted like a milk milkshake! I certainly would not return here to eat. I should have taken a cue from my server Tony when I asked him what was good to eat there. He asked me, ""You mean like a signature dish?"" I said yes. He said, ""Nothing"". Then he laughed and quickly said everything was good. Wrong!",Rant,2
"Went there yesterday (Oct 25) at about 4:00 PM. Had the nitro and it was delicious, hence earning the two stars. However, like *many* other reviewers here, the service is awful. Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade. I brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, ""No"". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup. Then, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed ""Can I hep you with something?"", to which I responded, ""oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi."" The barista responded, ""We have a sign, for you,"" again with a plethora of shade. Will never return, thanks for trying.",Rant,2

This place might be good during the week but weekend rush comes the left hand doesn't know what the right one is doing.. Kitchen is definitely understaffed and place is poorly managed... 4/15/18 So I figured I give this place another try!!!! Why or why did I make a dumb decision... Waited 40 minutes for scrambled egg and bacon on a plain bagel... Server was beyond horrible!! Where oh where is the manager!!

"Though top notch service is demanded at a JW, I was thoroughly impressed with the property, service, and staff. I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible, but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star.

"For my first time there it was not a bad experience. The Philly was actually really delicious. I was presently surprised. It is actually close to a philly from back home. My hot lemon pepper wings were also pretty good. My only problem is that I called in my order and they told me 15 minutes. I get there only to have to place my order all over again after I told them I placed an order. They then called me and told me that my order was waiting for me. *rolls eyes* How they missed that they made the exact same two orders is beyond my understanding. I also asked for just flats both times and didn't get it. The food was good (minus the fries that were ""freshly made"" but cold when I got home in 5 minutes lol) but the service was actually pretty terrible so prepare yourself for that part.",Rant,2

"Update! Alyssa (the manager), called me this morning to apologize for rushing through my question yesterday. She also advised that she would be doing some extra training with Stephanie to work on her front desk servicing skills. I was very pleased to hear that Alyssa took accountability, and apologized... instead of giving me a bunch of excuses. I was very pleased with her outreach, and I was pleased at that point. On top of that, she went above and beyond to make it up to me by giving me a credit on my account. I didnt expect that nor did i demand that, i was happy with her response. This shows good character in a manager. Owning it and not making excuses. So I'm going to start off with the positives. 1.) Quick service while waxing, I was in and out within 15 minutes, which is super convenient when I want to quickly run over to get a wax during my lunch or right after work. I've gone twice so far, and I've never waited more than 30 seconds. 2.) Lea, my Wax Specialist (both times) is the only reason why I come back to this place. She's friendly, quick, precise, and makes me feel comfortable. It's a shame her colleagues don't achieve this much. First trip The first time i went there, Stephanie greeted me and wanted to get rid of me ASAP. She took my license and said she would give it back when I came out. She didnt tell me why, and when I asked, she snapped back at me and said she needs to put my information in the computer and smirked at me like I was an idiot. I never leave my license with anyone, and I think I have a right to ask why you need my license. How long does it take to type in my name and address anyway? Did I say I wanted the company to have my address anyway? Why not ask before you take information from your clients. When my wax was over, I came out and paid, and still Stephanie wanted me out of her face. It was my first time here, so I had some questions about the products and packages, and she had no time for it. Oh, I'm sorry that I'm delaying you by asking you to sell me more stuff. Needless to say, even though I wanted to buy the package, her lack of enthusiam or selling skills, had me just walk away. Second trip. I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door by Alyssa, she checked me in, and when i wanted to ask a question about a service, she said ""whats up?!"" as if I was bothering her. She responded to my question, but didnt answer it, bc she didnt want to understand my question. Sorry, I'm a new customer still, and I would like to know the answer to one question without a respond like ""they will do as much or as little as you want""... umm.. that doesnt answer my question. but thanks? After my wax, I checked out with Devin, I think that was her name.. she was super polite and willing to answer my questions. I bought the package with her. And i could not believe Alyssa was a manager?!!! What a terrible way to treat your customer, and show how you act in front of other peers.... so it becomes contagious. Maybe Devin should become the manager. Lindsay seems like she has her head screwed on straight too. Wax Specialist Lea is on her game. Manager Alyssa and Stephanie, you need to train on your customer service skills, and knowing your products a little better, or take your time to understand what the client is asking. Lea is great, but if I have to keep dealing with rude receptionists, I can head back to heads and tails.. the only reason why i tried EWC is because of the easiness to book an appointment. If your going there, ask the wax specialist your questions... bc the front desk sucks.",Rant,2
"I'm sad to report that Taste of Havana left me a little disappointed. When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport. (Funny enough, she was picking me up after my trip to Miami, so Cuban food was already on my mind.) The Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. We also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. The cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. It should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door. Underwhelming on a number of levels, and nowhere equal to the hype. The Cuban place on Moller and 38th is far superior.",Rant,2
"For years, I have lamented about the lack of good cajun food in Philly. Thank you, Beck's, for filling this GAPING void. I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you. Also, no credit card machine here so bring CASH. WHAT WE ATE *Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa. *Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. *Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. *Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. *Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar. Beck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available. I'm not a root beer fan so haven't tried, but I keep hearing awesome things about it.",Rant,2
"Service is terrible, food is ok, location is great (which is why the average yelp review is currently hanging to a mediocre 3 stars). I've been here many times. It's always about the same. Very convenient, as it's located in Jackson Square. The open window seating is great. The food is ok, not great, but edible. The service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place), and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled ""you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!"" Umm, ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed? Overall, management is the problem. No standard protocol, and not much training for their workers.",Rant,2
"I saw Big Data when they came to town at the Knitting Factory. Some things: The area is really skeazy. I am happy Reno is trying to change the image of the city, but that cannot be accomplished over night and this place is super creepy. The sound quality is horrible. If you want to REALLY hear the band you paid to see, go somewhere else. The building is not shaped right for a concert venue and because of it, the sound will sooner bust out your eardrums.",Rant,2

Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that. Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer.,Rant,2
"We did the 2:30pm lunch on the Natchez. The boat was pleasant, we got the $12 beverage add on which gave unlimited bloody mary's, mimosas and the Natchez Punch. I will say don't get this for the bloody marys. They were terrible. We all switched to the punch and as long as you take care of the bartender, he will alter it to your liking. The staff was all great. Not a single complaint there. The bad part was the food. Nobody in our party was impressed with it. The fish was OK but the highlight was the bread pudding. With so many other great options to eat at in New Orleans, don't do this for the food. We are glad we did it to get the history of the shores and such but once was enough.",Rant,2
"I am disappointed with the turkey sub. It tastes like cheap lunch meat. I could have made this sub myself and for nearly $5 this isn't worth it. Unfortunately this place has lost stars in my eyes due to the lack of quality with the turkey. I will try this place again, but will never eat their turkey again. I honestly would rather go to subway since there is a variety of sauces and bread, which makes this chain a better value for your money. This place isn't horrible, I think I made a bad selection and will probably try their pastrami next time.",Rant,2
"It's a good thing I've had a few weeks to cool off from my experience at Copabanana before writing this review or it might not have been pretty. Anyhow, I came during university city restaurant week and will never return. We sat outside and there were kids playing football right near the tables and being loud. We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress.",Rant,2
"I gave this restaurant 5 stars 3 years ago. Since then I have had several dinners and parties there and recommend them to multiple friends. But after the second horrible experience there I have to speak out. (Last year I was racially profiled. The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said ""So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9."" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night. I love the food and the karaoke room, but tonight was my last visit there. I STRONGLY recommend another restaurant. There are so many other restaurants that will give you the Chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap. So, so, disappointed!",Rant,2

"Went to dinner here with friends, and can't help but question the folks who said they had terrible service or so so food. we had an exceptional waiter, who truly knew the food, the wine, and wasn't afraid to make recommendations. loved him, very professional. The ambiance was excellent too. I do enjoy the bright lights, modern feel of some of Tucson's newer restaurants, but this was a nice break from that. For dinner at least, it was low lighting, elegant, real Tucson feel. The place was hopping, there was light jazz played live, the drinks were amazing...the food OUTSTANDING. my friends can be somewhat hard to please...and Maynard's wowed them. I'm going back today for lunch with coworkers, and hope it's as good...without the dinner menu. Have heard great things about the Cuban style pulled pork sandwich. ok...UPDATE: Cuban pork sandwich is amazing! slow roasted, melt in your mouth pork on a delicious ciabatta bread, with spicy mayonnaise, fresh cilantro, roasted jalapenos...can't go wrong! very nice to sit on the patio in the afternoon, too!",Rant,2
"The service and bathroom was horrible, The soap Dispenser didn't work (and the toilets were out of order) Zaxby's need to do better with who they are hiring and the cleanliness of the store. The lady at the drive thru and the cooks did not have on a hair net. The sweet tea was sour, the ice machine took forever (it seems like) to dispense ice. The chicken strips and fries were dry. The person taking my order was not welcoming at all. All the employees on the front line seem to be playing around rather then working. A lot of lout talking coming from the back. Not a inviting environment at all, I will not come back to this location and I ""suggest"" strongly that ""You"" think about it twice before coming to this location.",Rant,2
"I stop here frequently since it is right off the hwy on my way home from work. This is the best of the Schnucks in the city itself, although I have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there. The staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city Schnucks, which again is not really that hard to accomplish. The selection of merchandise could be much better, for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet, apparently the locals don't care if they are 300+ lbs, as the managers tell me there is no demand for it. The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date. The weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises. To the contrary, they seem welcomed, one even wears a Schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles, sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy. Perhaps characters like this are considered quaint by the locals, but they illustrate why I left for south county back in the day.",Rant,2
"Four stars for the comfy recliners. Didn't order any food. First showing will cost $10 per ticket, $12 per ticket all other shows. There was a real bad sewage smell near the kitchen that made me decide not to order food. They had just opened up and only 8 people in theater. Guess they need to advertise. Looked at the menu and typical prices for food at a movie. Different from cinebistro as they allow kids before 6pm. $5 beer and $4 bottled water. Go figure!! Website said $6 popcorn but menu says $7. Strange that they raised price. Didn't they just open? Anyway it's closer than cinebistro so I'm glad for that. Also glad we went to see action packed Man of Steel or I could have easily zonked out.

"If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you. Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo. She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better. When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink. She said ""oh that's only Pepsi"". Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke. We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco. She let us know cheese was extra. It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips. When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food. Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00. Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",Rant,2
"I have never been so insulted and talked down to in my life. Michelle, I think that's her name it's on my receipt but she never introduced herself, was the rudest person I have ever given my money to in my life. When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times ""these menus are good for the next 30 seconds."" Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change, don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were, her words, 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all, so we didn't know what they were for. Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar, not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one, get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that ""buy one get one"" and ""2 for 1"" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us). After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that ""they weren't trying to screw us."" She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars/restaurants/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right. Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders, she is turning people away for good. This treatment was so horrible and off putting that I am going to go out of my way to recommended against going to Tavern due to the disrespect we felt. Hopefully your floor managers recognize how bad she is and theyo do something about it because she is taking money out of your pocket every shift she works.",Rant,2
"Caution- Absolutely - stay away. There was nothing about the food that can redeem how unusually bad the food was here. While the staff is very accommodating, you're better off skipping this restaurant. I worked in a very large well known Cajun/creole restaurant and what we were served was very bland and poorly prepared. Red beans were definitely from a can. I didn't taste any of the distinct flavors of red beans n rice. There was no ham hock flavor, no bay leaf flavor or discernible mirepoix flavor. The collard greens tasted like they had been boiled without any additional seasoning and served, poorly drained. I couldn't eat it. The jambalaya was also very odd, most definitely from some prepackaged mix. The jambalaya barely had any meat in it and was definitely not close to anything like jambalaya. They aught to be ashamed of calling that Jambalaya. It was more like frozen mixed vegetable rice pilaf, seriously. Jambalaya ""jambon a la aya"" the jambon (ham) is the core of the dish, seriously. Wtf. If the management is reading this: revise your recipes and quality check often. It's a downward spiral when you sacrifice quality. One of us who are the crawfish etouffe had terrible food poisoning. I think there are issues with storage, food rotation, labeling and training. Several hours after writing the review, I was sick.",Rant,2
"We ate in. Awful pizza. Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side. Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability. Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease. We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music. Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was, however, very accommodating when he was available. If you decide to go, I wish you much better luck. Rating on pizza = minus 2.5",Rant,2

"It is with a heavy heart that I have to write this review. I gave this place so many second chances because I used to work in the building it resides in, the Indiana Historical Society, and was the closest option for lunch. The complaint is with the service. I could list the numerous times when an order I placed earlier in the day wasn't ready on time, but that is a special arrangement for IHS employees. But in my last week, everything went downhill. The first incident occurred when I ordered a salad with no dressing. One of the cooks had to exclaim in the nearly empty cafe ""No dressing?!? Who in their right mind doesn't eat dressing?!"" This is just out and out unnecessarily rude. As a former food server, I've ran across my fair share of bizarre food orders, and one doesn't say anything about it until the customer is gone or go somewhere the customer can't hear you, and say it there. I said something to the manager, which rendered dirty looks from the cooks and a retaliation. The final time I ate there: once again my early order for a grilled cheese was late. I was made to wait 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break to cook a two cheese and tomato sandwich. When I got it, the cheese was barely warm and not melted. I complained, and was thrown attitude back from the manager for not ordering sooner. Ordering at 10:30 am for a 1:30pm pick up is not early enough? For a half-assed grilled cheese?! The cook who criticized my food choice earlier in the week gave me a condescending smile from the kitchen. The retaliation was complete. And I was not given a refund. Final straw. I wanted to forewarn everyone that the cooks (for now) apparently have no respect for customers, and aren't afraid to show it. Management and the cooks are in a revolving door mode, so I have no doubt that they will be gone soon enough. So I might recant this review in the future. Normally the food is fantastic and I can totally recommend the curry chicken salad sandwich, the french fries (crack fries as the employees call them), the quiches, and the grilled cheeses - when they are fully cooked.",Rant,2

It's not dirty, per se. It just doesn't look very clean. Everything looks like its falling apart. It probably gets its business from suburbanites like me craving what we think of as Chinese food. All that said, the food I had was palatable. Nothing outstanding or amazing: it was just all right.

The second time the food was still very good but half of the food came out about 15 min before everyone else's food after an already long wait. This last time was the worst experience I have had thus far. I ordered food to go and they said it would be 15-20 min. The food took 45 minutes. They left out my guacamole and a chicken taco. I also ordered the steak and bean quesadilla which had no beans on it, no lettuce, sour cream, pico or guacamole, and also had a hair in it. When I called to complain the manager was unapologetic and only offered a refund if I was willing to ""take the food back"" when I was already across town. I did not expect a full refund but the least they could do is apologize and offer to refund the quesadilla and the guacamole and chicken taco that were left out of the order. I was mostly upset by the fact that I wanted to love this place. I really tried but I will not be back.",Rant,2

"Awful. Avoid this place. I took my car here on a slow Sunday morning. When I got home I noticed a good size ding and scratch on my driver side rear door. I took it back and spoke to a manager named Chris. He was not helpful at all. His response was ""there is nothing here that would have done that."" So why was it not there when I came in, and now it's here. He had no answer or solution. I asked for the corporate number. He told me I could call his GM who will decide if it needs to go to corporate or not. Thanks Chris, very helpful. When asking what their policy is for incidents, he could not give me an answer. All he would say is ""there is nothing here that would do that."" It's a car wash, thousands of moving parts and things touching the car. There is most definitely something that could do that. Especially when I watch the guys drying the the cars put the rags on the ground and pick them back up to continue drying the cars. Rocks, nails, anything hard. I expected more. I cannot imagine this is the first time this has happened, and by the looks of how seriously they take responsibility, it won't be the last.",Rant,2

"Myself and a family member went into Table Talk to purchase a new living room table about a month ago, the table was one from reclaimed Indian Teak, and we were very excited about the table! After speaking to the owners, managers, and a few employees they loved the idea of the table. We got a great deal, paid the down, and waited the 4 weeks to hear back from them saying that our order was in and ready to be delivered. Then the phone rang. It was the owner (I cannot remember his name, he was an older gentlemen), and told us that they couldnt get the base of the table, and wouldnt be able to put the table together. He said that they could still sell us the top of the table, but there would be no discount. We were rather confused about the request, and politely declined to purchase the table from them at that point. Back to the drawing board! So, we did some research and found the table from their vendor through a friend who purchases wholesale furniture. The cost was the same that they charged us from the wholesale vendor, that Table Talk wanted to charge us! Now, that doesnt make much economic sense to us. In conclusion, we found it odd that they would 1. Lie to us, saying that they couldnt get the table, when they just mischarged us, 2. Attempted to scam us out of the difference in cash instead of just taking the loss on their business, and 3. That they would so disregard the common good practices of business. If you are looking for unique furniture, there are so many better places that have ethics and integrity. Avoid Table Talk at all costs!",Rant,2
"I wish I could give Moto 3.5 a stars, because it really wasn't a bad meal. It just wasn't a standout meal. My husband and I went to Moto on a date night, not a special occasion. I enjoyed my glass of Sangiovese, and my husband enjoyed his cocktail. He had a pasta dish with a creamy tomato sauce and sausage, which was good, but tasted like a rather pedestrian Italian pasta dish. Take away the pretty dishes and beautiful table, and I think it was just about as good as any other creamy tomato pasta with sausage dish. My entrée was a black bucatini with seafood. The bucatini was good, and sauce was appropriately light and spicy. And the shrimp was pretty well cooked - something that does not happen all the time in Nashville. But the pasta was light on seafood. When lobster is listed on the menu, I want to see and taste the lobster! We also got a half order of the grilled artichoke hearts, which were very well cooked. We shared a dessert, a spicy peanut tart, which was interesting. The restaurant is beautiful, very modern, very hipster Nashville, very dark. The service was great. Really, truly - everyone was very helpful and nice and informed about the menu. So, it really wasn't a terrible meal. But it wasn't one of the better Italian meals I've in Nashville. And I didn't leave very pleased with the meal overall. Good, not great.",Rant,2

When I got there, I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20), she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.' She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill, the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday, I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business!",Rant,2
"Well it must be time for Charter internet's weekly shut down. Their internet service is absolutely terrible. As soon as I find an alternative, I won't be able to cancel charter soon enough. Horrible service.",Rant,2
"I stopped here because it looked nice and my friends and I were starving. Upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door (we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us) and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away. We waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because I had to flag down another server when she walked passed us (and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server) to greet a table who just walked in. Our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when I suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said ""yeah lets just get this all over with at once"". The burger was disgusting, it looked like a McDonalds hamburger but greasier. I just got coffee so I can't say I tasted it but if it had been served to me I would have returned it. I had to flag the server down for the check and when I put my card out to be taken (everyone else was paying in cash) he walked by literally six times without taking the card. I ended up just paying cash. I have served my entire college career so I understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something I will never understand. Yes, we are tourists just like probably 90% of the restaurant (it was Sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away) but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly. This was the first time I have not tipped someone and this is the first time I've written a negative review but I was really that upset about it. I made sure to tell all my friends to steer clear of this place when they visit.",Rant,2
"My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland, with almost no flavor, also, it was super spicy!! All in all, we didn't really like the food here.",Rant,2
"My husband picked up 2 acai bowls for me and our 2 year old son at the West Nashville location. My bowl was great, but I'm thankful my son did not eat his. I ate his bowl for breakfast the following morning and it had 3 huge pieces of plastic in it! It was disgusting and very dangerous if my son had eaten that. I contacted The Urban Juicer to tell about our experience. Their head of HR emailed me back within 24 hours apologizing, saying she already contacted the store to ensure it wouldn't happen again, and said the CEO would issue me a refund and a $10 gift certificate. It's been over a week and I have not received a refund or gift certificate. I sent a follow-up email this morning, but still have yet to hear back. I'm bummed about this entire experience because I loved Urban Juicer...but this experience was disgusting, dangerous, and handled poorly by management.",Rant,2
"The food here is amazing but is completely tarnished by the terrible waitress. If 0 stars was an option I would have selected that considering that the waitress attempted to murder my friend. The orders began as normal with myself and my friends informing the waitress that someone in our group is severely allergic to cucumber and that none of our dishes can contain cucumber. She said ""okay, the beef dish contains cucumber so do you want it taken out?"" We said ""yes"". The first order of dishes came out without cucumber and all was fine. The second order of dishes did not go well as cucumber was included on the dish. We asked the bus boy to take the dish back and he said he would have to get the waitress who came back and yelled at us that we did not inform her of a food allergy. She continuously yelled stating ""you ordered it like this"", ""I only brought what you ordered"", ""you get what you asked for"" and proceeded to get closer to my friend and yell in her face while my friend calmly tried to explain that we said we cannot have any cucumber on the table. She took the plate and then had the bus boy bring it back without cucumber. Given the severity of the allergy, we moved the plate to the opposite of our friend. We were unsure if the plate was taken back and just replated without cucumbers and felt that anaphylaxis wasn't worth it. After yelling, she refused to come back to our table the rest of the night and sent bus boys to take our requests. If you or anyone here has any food allergy, it's not worth the risk because even normal forewarning is useless here and if you try to clear up any misunderstanding the waitress may yell at you like they are from WWE. The busboys deserve all the credit for making the night salvageable as they were attentive, courteous, and on top of it.",Rant,2
"I got a concrete that was supposed to have Reese's and banana. When I got it, it was melted and disgusting with literally 2 small pieces of Reese's and maybe 1/5 of a banana. Had a minty taste too which is not what I expected haha. Disappointing for my first time at this place. Won't be going back",Rant,2
"The Owner is just as rude & crazy as the manager. He refuses to listen to employee's & customer complaints. I'd stay FAR away from this place. Even the Spring Hill owner said people call his store complaining about the manager at Little Road. Other employees I spoke with said she's awful to work for and people complain about her all of the time. They fired a waitress for not being able to come in on her OFF day due to the flooded roads. She WASN'T scheduled that day. I'm calling the news stations,BBB & the Labor Board since the owner won't listen either. I hope people hear this story and boycott your business! You would've saved yourself grief if you would've just listened Steve! Already have posted to FB and many friends said they will no longer eat there.",Rant,2
"If you're in it for the scene, it doesn't get better than The French Press in SB. If you're in it for the coffee, go somewhere else. I really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and I love supporting local businesses, but their drip coffee is over-roasted and WAY too bitter. Hot, iced, it doesn't matter. It's all super bitter. I wanted to like it so bad that I had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16-oz cup of coffee hand-chosen based on my desired flavor profile. It took 10-15 minutes to make and cost me $6. It was terrible. So. Effing. Bitter. To be clear, I'm specifically talking about their coffee in this review. Their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious, but I've never tried them. That's not really my jam. So if you're like me and just want a regular coffee, go somewhere else (Handlebar, SB Roasting Co.).",Rant,2
"Bubble tea is probably the only sweet thing in life that I absolutely have to have, and while this place is a bit out of the way, I go here quite often to get my fix. The flavors are damn good, despite being powdered mixes. Cleanliness is A+. Decor is cute and bright. I was so stoked that they didn't just have basic fruit flavors, but also taro, red bean, jasmine, et cetera. Much more authentic in terms of product and taro is my shit. SO good. They have traditional tapioca and bursting boba with fruity flavors. It's also in a strip mall with a really, really good Asian restaurant next door (Cantonese?) and by Cirilla's. Kill two birds with one stone, right? Kidding. Sort of. I haven't tried anything else here, but friends have all raved about everything from the froyo to the boba, so I'd definitely say it's a solid place overall. Only complaint would be: do NOT go during rush hour. Holy shit, I live in Broad Ripple and it took over an hour to get there. I mean rush hour is necessary evil, but this is terrible. Completely my fault for not paying attention to the time, but wow, that is an incredibly nerve-wrecking experience under those circumstances. Just avoid the mini-van, suburban 5:00PM rush and you'll be fine.",Rant,2
"Worst experience I have ever had at chipotle. The workers working at 11:30 at th front have terrible customer service. They were out of chicken and didn't even tell me when I told the young girl and I had very little choices of meat. My bowl wasn't even that good, I ended up getting chorizo. Waste of my $7. This place only gets 2 star because of the water",Rant,2
"The name gives a clear picture of the type of food you'll have: yummy, rich, tender, and after you eat it, you'll feel very drowsy. I think I have taken or have tried to take a nap every single time after I got home from this place. There is a lot to choose from on the menu (almost too much). The wait to get seated can be horrible on weekends, but once you're in, the place works like clockwork. The staff is friendly, isn't impatient, and gets you everything you want fast.",Rant,2
"This place gets one star they need to replace the whole staff me and my friends have labeled this place as super ghetto, some servers are nice I guess but there's no structure, management doesn't know how to compensate for horrible service, I've been to other applebees and it was not like this, I would suggest new management. And If you're looking for even a little bit of class don't come here.",Rant,2
"Ruined our Friday happiness. Thought it would be nice to go to Friendly's for a family meal to start the weekend...but the moment we arrived, I knew we should have left. Two employees at the front were talking to themselves, ignoring to greet us. When a 3rd employee asked his colleague where to seat us, she clearly wasn't eager to have us in her section, then she caught my eye as she then knew I heard her. We were guided to our table -- right next to the kitchen entry...meanwhile 1/2 the place was empty, as we passed by booths with ""broken"" signs on them and other dirty, uncleared tables. I asked to be seated at another booth--so we then were seated 1 row over from the kitchen entry... The initial ""Hi, I'm so-and-so"" was fine and we ordered our 3 meals and waited. Drinks arrived -- my glass of Coke was chipped and the other glass of Sprite tasted terrible, like seltzer. Asked for another Sprite and got the same terrible drink. Later, I spotted our 3 meals on the warmer (remember, we are sitting 1 row away from the kitchen...) and ironically the warmer shelf is next to a clock. 6:02pm. Waited and waited...server finally walked by and I had to let her know that our meals were ready -- ""Let me check,"" she says. 6:04pm. She goes missing...then she brings 2 of the 3 plates to our table and disappears again. I had to waved down another server and asked for my plate, still sitting on the warmer. 6:06pm. That server goes missing. Our original server finally brings my plate. Burger with the wrong cheese...over-cooked waffle fries. (Or maybe fries were over-cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as I stared at it.) Turkey BLT was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over-cooked too. I'm surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were (albeit robotic) but not surprised that when we said I got the wrong cheese, she said ""sorry"" without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake. We were ready to pay and eager to leave...we waved down another server who said she couldn't take our payment as our assigned server had to do it. We said ""Can you let her know?"" and she said ""I can't, she's with another table"" and walked away. We were in disbelief that this experience just got worse. The only good memorable moment was when I said under my breath ""This place is terrible,"" and my young son repeated me. Advice: Hire people who are actually Friendly or shut it down. This is an embarrassment. Will never go there again and probably never go to another Friendly's ever.",Rant,2
"Since I don't live in Reno (I live in Las Vegas), I didn't know anything about the concert venues up there. I heard a radio commercial & picked up tickets to the Halestorm (preceeded by Eve to Adam & In This Moment) show a couple weeks ago while I was up there. So, for the good & bad... Venue floorplan is HORRIBLE! It's long and narrow, which means the majority of attendees cannot even get a glimpse of the stage. I know I don't go to concerts to watch it on a tiny little TV screen. The first floor is so crowded that once in the door, it was a bear trying to get to the bar. The bartenders were so rude, too! The Over-21 lounge upstairs looked nice. But, again, good luck trying to see anything. I was lucky, though. There was a small group that went together & a couple of them let me wiggle up to the rail so I could see the bands play a few songs. The bar and bartenders up there were great! Not knowing the area, it took me forever to find a place to park. I ended up at a casino parking garage a few blocks away. I wasn't impressed that the entrance was in an alley. But, the will call lady was really nice. I really enjoy the more intimate venues, but this place was not for me.",Rant,2
"We took my father here for his 80th birthday. We made a reservation for a party of 10, but they did not seem to have the reservation. So, there was no table ready for us. It was early, so there was no issue with getting a table... we just had to wait for it to be assembled. Other than that, we enjoyed the experience. The waitress was attentive, and there was not a long wait for anything. Also, she did not add an automatic gratuity to the bill, even though we were a large party. There were no complaints about any of the food.",Rant,2
I was greated by a nice friendly staff. There wasnt a long wait for my food. I ordered a chicken bacon croissant with chipolte sauce. They cut it in half as requested and was served in maybe only 20 seconds after the time it took to cook. Food taste great,Rant,2
"So this was my first restaurant that I tried when I came to Philly for the first time. Their roti canai is the best that I've ever tried, that curry is soooo good! Their fried calamari is my sister's favorite here and it's decent for me. I love their kangkung balancing because it's the exact same one that I had back in Indonesia(I was born in Indonesia). Their rendang however doesn't match my tastebud. Their Indian mee goreng is so good! Also I have a little trouble with the peanut sauce that they serve, it's too sweet. Their coconut rice is just like regular white rice. Their service isn't the best for me but still okay. Probably clean the place a little bit more? The third time I came it was like dirty, like super dirty. And I heard a customer complained about finding a fly inside their dish so that's kind of disappointing for me. But I'll come back for their roti canai.",Rant,2
"I love me some MMM MMM MMM fall off the bone ribs, so I look forward to this event. Victorian Square in Sparks, NV is the place to be for Labor Day weekend. Great place to enjoy a time out with family and friends. Definitely the perfect event for all the meat lovers out there. If you show up early, parking won't be as bad as most people think. You'll be able to find parking some blocks away from the event. If you're lazy to walk, then there are parking lots where you can park and a shuttle can pick u up from there (check out website for the exact location: http://www.nuggetribcookoff.com/About-The-Event/About-The-Event.asp). Admission is FREE but your hunger will cost you. I suggest going with a big group so you can all share slab or half slab of ribs from each vendor. You'll get to sample more vendors that way, getting more bang for you buck. It's not worth it to get a sampler from the vendors because it's like $5 or $7 for 3 ribs. Usually they give you the bad part of the slab when you get the sampler, so it's a no no in my book. RIBS, KETTLE CORN, LEMONADE, ONION RINGS, FUNNEL CAKES and SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM! Throw your diet out the window and get down! It can get overwhelming wanting to try everything, but try to pace yourself. One complaint I have is the amount of shade there is because there is NONE! Make sure to wear a hat, sunglasses, and put on sunblock. You're going to need it standing in those loooooong lines under the BURNING SUN! The best place to cool off is in the John Nugget Casino. AC never felt so good. That's also the place to go if you want to purchase yourself a T-Shirt from the event. Overall, this is a nice little getaway for Labor Day weekend with your family and friends if you don't mind the heat. The busiest most crowded day will be on Labor Day. Traffic will be bumper to bumper, so I suggest going on any other day before then. Hope you all enjoy the RIBS, KETTLE CORN, LEMONADE, ONION RINGS, FUNNEL CAKES, and SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM! You're going to be feeling icky and a little more heavier after you're done but it's all about the GOOD TIMES!",Ad,0

"I would give Dr Ilyas five stars for friendliness, professionalism, and thoroughness. Her front desk personnel is as awful, as she is good. The first problem occurred when I called to make an appointment on 5/11/17. I was told that I could get in on a cancellation in two days, at 10:40 a.m. I immediately put the time in my calendar. Then, I was told that if I preferred, a 9:40 had also opened up. I said that 10:40 worked much better for me. That afternoon, I received a confirmation call, stating that I was scheduled for 9:40. I called back immediately, but of course, my appointment time was already given to someone else. Not happy, but at least I was getting in quickly. I was seen there on 5/13/17 as a new patient. You would think that the first people who greet you, would put their best foot forward. What I received was a, ""sign in here, and fill out these pages"". It was like being greeted by disinterested teenagers. It went downhill from there. I was called back to the desk and told that my insurance card didn't match Aetna's information for me. I said that I had been using the same I.D. number for at least 7 years, and have had all of my claims go through with the info on the card. She was practically accusing me of using someone else's insurance, and that I would be responsible for the bill when it didn't get paid. Now, there is a designated phone number for employees of my husband's company. It never takes more than 1 minute to connect to someone. Instead of wasting time arguing with me, she could have taken the initiative to call the number on the card. Somehow, she finally found my information, but still insisted that the number on my card was incorrect. Nothing else was said, she just handed me the card, while looking as annoyed as possible. I should add that I am a healthcare professional, and I know the importance of having a good front desk staff. Maybe the doctors never hear what goes on at that office, but hopefully, they will pay attention to reviews. If you want a good dermatologist, I recommend Dr Ilyas. Just be prepared for the condescending young women at the desk.",Rant,2
"Tires etc. Has quick, reliable and affordable service. The best staff (polite and honest) i never feel taken advantage of. I am on a tight budget and i was trying to purchase the least expensive tires for my car. There was only one of the tires I wanted in stock, so they upgraded the tires at the discounted rate. We got new brakes at Midas, they squeaked, squealed and sometimes grind something awful (it was embarrassing). Midas told me it was an issue with the make of our car (although they never squeaked or grind before unless we needed repair). Tires etc replaced those Midas brakes and viola! squeaking and grinding gone and I even paid less. Needed front headlight on 2009 Malibu (a tricky job) pep boys had our car for 2 hours then told us they couldnt do it, go to dealership. Midas told us they could but charged over a hundred dollars. Dealership was booked for appts till next week. Tires etc did it in an hour for about $50 less than Midas. Enough said this is the only place we take our car. Oh yeah one more thing, the waiting area is the BEST! oversized leather arm chairs. Always clean, comfortable, hot and cold refreshments, cable TV and wifi!",Rant,2
"Incredibly unfriendly staff. The place a filthy disaster. Dirty dishes all over the place. Trash bags sitting out like someone attempted to change the trash. They were out of many things at the drink area (lids, napkins). Used the lack of a cook as an excuse for all their issues but positioned it as an inconvenience to them and not apologetic to customers at all.",Rant,2
"My fiancee and I stayed here over the Veterans Day holiday because we had a coupon. Apparently everyone had the same genius idea I did because when we got there the line was pretty long. We waited about 30 minutes to check in but it was worth the wait. We stayed in room 1534 in the Tuscany Towers. The spa rooms were sold out by the time we got there so we couldn't upgrade but this room was amazing anyways. The room is a good size with plenty of sitting room. We had a king size bed with a comfortable mattress and soft blankets/sheets and the room smelled good too. The flat screen TV was a nice feature. The bathroom was the best part. A ginormous Whirlpool soaking tub with jets and a large walk-in shower with two shower heads. We enjoyed the his/her bathroom sinks, since he always like to hog the sink. ;) We never got to experience either pools or the spa. The pool on the upper deck was closed during our stay. Maybe because it's suppose to be cold, like winter. (Hint: Mother Nature) The pool on the lower deck was always swarming with kids from the time it opened until it closed. It would be nice if they could have one of the pools open to the 18 and over crowed, but not worth complaining about. The decor and paintings all over the hotel hallways and walkways are beautiful. The arcade was nice and it wasn't crowed when we stopped by so we were able to enjoy it. The only complaints and the reason I couldn't give a full five stars are below: 1.) The awful smell of smoke! We are not smokers and luckily we aren't much gamblers either. (Yes, we went to a casino for the hotel only) The times when we did venture out on the casino floor for a meal or drinks wasn't a pleasant experience. There should be a bigger non-smoking area. We found one SMALL non-smoking bar but it was crowded and drinks were weak. 2.) The price of food and beverages are really high. $7.75 for a small bottle of water? $19.75 for the smallest bottle of wine I've seen? $7.00 for M&M's? Come on now. This is robbery. I understand that you pay for the convenience for not having to leave your room but that is ridiculous. We ended up going to the local Raley's and buying some drinks, snacks and storing them in the provided ice bucket. Which brings me to the next issue... 3.) There was no place to store our personal drink or food items because the refrigerator was full of items your were charged for if you moved them. We spent $70 for dinner at Biscotti's (good food) and we couldn't even keep our leftovers because there was no where to store them. With all that space in the room, you could at least give your guests a functional refrigerator. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will stay again in the future.",Rant,2
"Came about 7 on a Saturday night (7 July 2018) after attending a wedding in town. We were just walking around looking for a place with decent indoor seating so we could escape all the smokers who seem to infest the streets of Reno. Husband enjoyed the soccer on the tv, and the inside was loud but not terrible. Our server, Jared L, gave us time with the menu, and we ordered a mixed green salad with lemon vinaigrette ($4.25) to share, the lamb burger with no olive salsa and a wheat bun ($10.50), and the barley chicken ($9.95). We both were big fans of the salad dressing; I would have bought a bottle to take with me, if possible. The barley chicken had a lot of barley, too much for my husband's taste, but it was good in general. My lamb burger was perfect and delicious. It was one of the best burgers I've had. The goat cheese really complimented the lamb (which isn't a very tasty meat on its own), and it was perfectly cooked. The burger was so big I couldn't finish it, and reheating wasn't an option, so I was sad to leave so much behind. Total bill was $26.75 with only water to drink. We would return here if ever back in Reno.",Rant,2
"This salon is awful. I've seen bugs there in the past. But this particular visit, I went in for a spray tan... and as I am waiting I can hear the room next to me getting a spray- and it was obvious my machine was obsolete... they didn't even have the heater on in the room. And I was never offered the better option when I walked in. Just stuck with the crappy versaspa... the other person in the versapro was still getting sprays as I was leaving- leading me to believe I was taken for my money since I only got sprayed twice... I will be going to Shine from now on.. at least their rooms are consistent.",Rant,2
"Not worth all the hype. You order when you walk in the door, take a number and sit down. The food runners wander around the dining area looking for your number. The food did come out fast, but we didn't get our drinks for 10min or so after getting food. Blood Mary was awful. Biscuits, gravy and chicken was all good. I would be willing to give it another try, but I would not wait in line or rush to go back.",Rant,2
"So. Big disappointment. DosA's were clearly made yesterday. They were in a large pile on a makeshift grill, looking pretty limp and sad. Kebabs were mixed with the tandoori chicken, and were also just being reheated. Tandoori chicken was very dry. Chicken biryani isn't really a biryani. Just rice mixed with some type of curry. Makes some sense I guess if this was a 6 dollar student buffet, but nope 30 dollars for 2 ppl. Never going back.",Rant,2
"I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor, I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them. The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good. The gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything, we just got the check and left. We will not be returning.",Rant,2

"Went here for the first time last weekend. Called ahead to try and make a reservation but they only do those for groups of 6 or more. Being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. We chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait. I had the cocktail featuring egg whites, and it was very very tasty (compares well to some similar cocktails I've had at Thunderbird). Once we finally were seated the food was all delicious. The crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing, and reminded me of the flavor of bugles. The skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that, so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops. The food and drinks were awesome, and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by. Final note: if you do sit at the upstairs bar next to a door, be forewarned that the door will bump you repeatedly as management and staff access the closet during the night. It becomes more annoying the longer you sit there because it's unavoidable and a terrible design flaw.",Rant,2
