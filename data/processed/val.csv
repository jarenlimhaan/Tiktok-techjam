"Four of us stopped in for a quick lunch on a Sunday in February. We walked through the deli to the balcony along the back, found a table, and ordered Cuban sandwiches and salads. Eventually the drinks came, and then 45 minutes later, the food arrived. Everything was tasty. The only reason our rating is not higher is because of the long wait for our food. We would definitely go back, tho'.",Rant,2
Room has carpeting!! Yikes. Smells awful... I'll go somewhere where I can breathe and not think about all the sweat in the carpeting.,Rant,2
"Gus is the best! His commitment to quality ingredients and preparation details are inspiring. Unfortunately, I got my platter today and had NO FALAFEL....from a falafel truck! So, after browsing Yelp, I learned that his fryer broke and the cost is too high to fix. I started a gofundme to see if we can raise the 3k to bring back falafel!!! It's under falafel fryer for Gus. https://www.gofundme.com/falafel-fryer-for-gus",Ad,0
"This custard is good-so is Culvers...that being said, when you order a tart cherry custard for your daughter who wants pink custard and can't have strawberries, only to see strawberries in her custard a couple minutes after she's been eating it, then being told by the teenage boy with a sarcastically dirty look, ""you just now noticed?"" Not the best customer service skills...yeah, I just noticed because my daughter was eating it, not me...I didn't see any when I handed it to her...and then he proceeds to begrudgingly request they make an actual tart cherry custard...ugh...frustrating!",Rant,2
"Avoid this place if you really want to get some sleep. The hotel is very noisy since it is next to the airport. Not a great place to base a business visit from. The bed was hard as a rock, the pillow had black hair on it, (I am blonde) and the carpets were stained and dirty. The bathroom tiles were missing large chunks of grout and it didn't feel clean. The staff was great, the only saving grace",Rant,2
"So much to muse about the Three Muses! Located in the heart of the French Quarter, it's one of the few spots that boasts live music and full meals (not just bar food) and specialty cocktails. They normally take reservations but we visited on Labor Day around 8 or 9 p.m. and didn't have a wait. I ordered their version of a margarita and it was delicious. It included jalapeno but it was understated and the heat didn't really factor that much. I ordered the bulgogi rice bowl and was so impressed when it came out. It's a hearty size and is so layered in flavor that every bite was a delight. The waitstaff was a bit spotty but not anything too terrible to deal with and the live music that night was enjoyable. The band interacted with the crowd and even sang 'happy birthday' to the tables who were celebrating birthdays that night/weekend. If you want a good meal while enjoying live music, definitely make a stop at Three Muses!",Rant,2
"I enjoyed the food here. I had the shrimp tom yum soup, which had a kick to it but was really delicious and then the sweet potato tempura roll and the avocado roll and it was all delcious. My friend enjoyed her meal as well, although, we both felt that it was a little too expensive and the parking lot is VERY small. The only downfall was the dessert, which was honestly terrible. I got the chocolate cake thing. I can't remember its official name but it was recommended by the waitress and it was honestly just terrible. The cake had obviously been microwaved and it was bland, which was a feat to suck the flavor out of chocolate cake. It had a scoop of ice cream on the side which tasted like it was a bit frost bitten and actually had chunks of ice in it. Not great. On the bright side, the place is beautiful on the inside and the waitress was really friendly. We had the same girl both times we were there and I liked her and can overlook the poor dessert recommendation. I would go back and just stick to the sushi and rolls.",Rant,2
Today I went into this location around 5 pm and it was completely empty. The young girls that were working did not greet me and the girl who took my order was so snotty that I left without completing the order. This was my first time here and I had a horrible experience. I will not return.,Rant,2
"We decided on Morton's for dinner last night since all other restaurants had an extremely long wait. Morton's was delicious as always. The bone-in ribeye was seasoned to perfection, bacon mac and cheese was also delicious, and the crab cake was tasty. The apple martini was the best that I've ever had. Morton's is always a great choice",Rant,2
Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service.,Rant,2
"very clean table arrangement is good; waiters are very interested; they look immediately; the order comes without a long wait, the food is really delicious as it is said; it is excellent; I recommend it.",Rant,2
"My fianc√© and I ate breakfast here and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I had the beignets which were overly sweet and the filling didn't quite work. The fiance had the southern breakfast, said the eggs were cooked poorly and the grits were too salty. Overall it wasn't terrible, but it was probably the most disappointing meal we had during our four day trip to New Orleans. We did eat here on a Monday morning so it may have been an off day.",Rant,2
"Went to this place last weekend, I ordered some Kathi-rolls and the chicken pizza. The kathi-rolls were really good, but the pizza was pretty bad. The location was really horrible and it is street parking which is awful. It is a good place to order kathi-rolls for take out.",Rant,2
Horrible customer service! The employees here seem to hate life cause they don't smile and have a very nonchalant attitude to every customer in the line. One of the employees smelt like weed and looked like he just got done smoking a Bong! Another employee was very rude when she asked a customer not stick her hands over the glass when the customer was only trying to point out what she wanted. The employee didn't need to respond to the customer in such a rude manner. I just moved here to Brentwood and I'm very disappointed in this establishment and the employees here. These employees either need to be retrained and taught how to smile and or just need to be replaced with humans who actually love life and don't take their job for granted!,Rant,2
"I am really sorry for writing this, but I have been to this place a couple times in which I had ok experiences. It rarely gives you a good-looking manicure. However, today's experience was awful. She gave me 10 different nail shapes, no hand lotion, nothing. I still have my cuticles, and am very upset. I'll stop going to this place. Although it is a beautiful salon with lots of polish options, I don't think they have many professionals.",Rant,2
"Mediocre and expensive. I could not find prices listed anywhere when we ordered. This is also the first place I have ever encountered where a sandwich ""combo"" means with cheese, instead of a side of fries. They also charge you extra if you want gravy on the side. Roast beef ""combo"" was okay. It was tasty but very little meat compared to the HUGE bun. Onion rings were burnt. Fries were terrible. Mozzarella sticks meh. Oh and charged for peppers that I specifically said I didn't want but was given non the less. Will not frequent again, and I would strongly advise you to do the same.",Rant,2
Rude staff. Can't even get a salad order right. Overpriced by the slice. When we sat down to wait for our food I thought wow this is taking a long time given the fact we were the only people in there. I guess it should stay that way. Don't waste your money.,Rant,2
"So I went to this fine establishment yesterday after a night out on the town. Was looking for some quality pizza and possibly some wings. The wait was a little long but not terrible considering the night rush. I got a large pepperoni and a dozen wings with a side of hot sauce. Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good, wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway, go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings. I'm sure the owner will read this so my message is: yeah we might be drunk when we order but we remember the next day and apparently this isn't an isolated event according to my friends. Deuces. (Drops mic)",Rant,2
"I was planning to attend the boxing match on Saturday, July 29. I received an e-mail promising a 20% discount if I bought the ticket by a certain deadline (which has not yet expired). I could not find a place on the website to enter the promo code, so I called the phone number provided. After going through the automated system, I got a human, who shuffled me off to another, and she said that I would have to use the promo code in person. Well, I live in Scottsdale, and I am not going to travel to Tucson without knowing I have a ticket, so what do I do? She said I would have to ask for the promo when I got there. I see one of three possibilities about the promo code: (1) scam; (2) antiquated ticket system not yet ready for the Internet; or (3) uniformed staff that cannot answer a simple question on where to type the promo code.",Rant,2
Both times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours. the employees don't seem to listen when we order. For example I had to tell one person my order 3 times and when I repeated myself they seemed like I was imposing on them. The food is standard for Wendy's but the customer service is terrible. I won't go back which is rather unfortunate because it's just down the street.,Rant,2
i've been to dickey's in at least three locations in other cities. usually its great and i enjoy the meats and the sides. great weekly specials. i was totally disappointed with this trip in new orleans. the manager was training the new staff on how to cut meat and serve it up. terrible job. everybody knows you cut brisket against the grain and thin. mine was awful and i didn't know until i got back to the hotel. i have not gone back. great sauces and sides. free ice cream and great desserts. too bad about the brisket. i love the ribs so i may try it again.,Rant,2
"This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First, they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover, but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came, we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again.",Rant,2
"Long wait, but worth it. Best Thai I can find in Nashville. Busy, a little cramped.. but the food was SO delicious, and the owner is great.",Rant,2
"I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost. I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap). Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk. The Good: I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium). They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice. We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested. the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef? Service was good, prompt, and polite. The Not So Good: The decor is awful. The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them. The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song. How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it. Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing. You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate? If you want great steaks for a good price, go here. But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.",Rant,2
"I went to the apple bees in this location and it was an unpleasant experience, The tables i arrived at were dirty, when i ordered i got a salad and the 2 for 20 meal for me and my uncle when the food arrived my soda tasted like windex and my uncles rice on his plate was like eating plastic pellets it was clearly overcooked. I will definitely not be returning to this Applebee's anytime soon. Thank you for reading my review.",Rant,2
"The food here is tasty - love the brisket and the cheese grits. BUT - we have had terrible luck with take out. Tried it three times, and an item was missing every time. A disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restaurant.",Rant,2
"The secret to GIgi and Big R is NOT to order the fried chicken. The fried chicken is still a very solid choice, but nothing too special. Instead go with the jerk chicken. It's just a little bit spicy and it's oh-so-tender and juicy. For sides, I almost always go with the mac n' cheese and the dirty rice. The mac n' cheese is much like the fried chicken, very solid but nothing special. However, the dirty rice is amongst the best I've had, and yes, I have had Bojangles. Also, skip the sandwich. It's just...chicken between two slices of plain white bread. Get the platter! Yes, you can expect to wait for your food at Gigi's, but it's worth it!",Rant,2
"We had both of the two French toasts--both were good. The pork belly benni pleased but my ""steak and and eggs"" biscuit was the best. This place gets mobbed on a weekend morning. By 9:00 am there's a long wait, and parking is a problem too.",Rant,2
"Ordered the small plate tortellini. It wasn't cooked and had a long brown hair mixed into the marinara sauce. I went back to return the food and was the gentleman behind the countered became argumentative and defensive. He then begrudgingly gave me a refund and offered no other solution. Too add to the already terrible experience, he sarcastically wished a 'nice day'.",Rant,2
"I have no idea what these people are talking about. This place is disgusting. I'm from San Antonio Texas, so I know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. I'm not expecting New Orleans to have outstanding Mexican food, but this place is completely gross. Eat at your own risk.",Rant,2

"TERRIBLE FOOD TERRIBLE SERVICE! I never complain, but had to warn others... The place looked nice, till we got our waiter who was apparently an american coach from Brooklyn lol.... He repeatedly shoved at us the 2 most expensive meals on the menu even though we just wanted tacos. The tacos were the size of half dollars and bare. Highly disappointing and both my boyfriend and I were sick all night.",Rant,2
"I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",Rant,2
Staff was nice. Food was similar to dominos or Pizza Hut on a bad day. Place was dirty and out dated.,Rant,2
"From the very beginning the hostess was also working as the cashier so we weren't even welcomed when we came in. We had to ask the hostess for a table and we're made to wait for no good reason. The server was pretty much non existent and was very unfriendly she didn't even introduce herself or stop by the table (let alone ask us how our food was). I order the biscuits and gravy and a side of eggs. My food was cold when it came out and wasn't even that good. And on top of it all the food is way overpriced ($30 for French toast, biscuits and gravy, and 2 sides? NO THANKS). Don't even bother wasting your time or money here. Overall terrible, definitely never coming back.",Rant,2
"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Same as everyone else, my husband & I were very excited to have us some BBQ after our movie only to be let down by the very dry, over cooked meat, undercooked stuffed bland potato & can greenbeans. Chef Ramsey & Irvine would have chewed Billy Bob to pieces. As an App we ordered the wings which tasted like cardboard & seemed as though they sat under a heating lamp for the last hour. No ranch dipping sauce came w/ them I ordered the pulled pork undercooked, bland bake potato. I had to add tons of butter and sour cream so get the tatter to go down. My husband ordered the 3-meat platter. His meat was very dry & not flavorful. He drowned his pulled pork in the BBQ sauce condiments from the table The best part of our meal were the fountain drinks. Our server Mila was very good. Some guy came to see how our food was & walked away heading to the bar where he had a drink waiting leaving my dirty plate for someone else to pick up . I HATE when dirty dishes are left on the table. I do not care who you are, restaurant manager, floor manager, no-one is to good to remove the dirty dishes. For a $48 lunch I should have stuck to my original plan of homemade fajita's!",Rant,2
"Prototypical crusty Florida neighborhood bar. Points for longevity- been in business long as I can remember. Drink and service quality is dependent on who you get and their particular mood at the time. Bar food is decent, and the wings are particularly good. A tad dirty, but that just gives it some character.",Rant,2
"Came here to get away from the horrible food at the amusement park and was pleasantly surprised. Service was friendly and quick. food was tasty and homemade. We got some steamed veggies to balance the plate of fried foods we ended up ordering. If you are intending to go for taste over health than this is the place. Onion rings with horseradish sauce, hush puppies, fish and chips and kids fried shrimp were all great. Its a pub atmosphere but the service doesn't treat you like it. We were there around 6 and it was quiet (until our 3 year old showed up). Very family friendly and a good break from the park.",Rant,2
"I have eaten at barbarians multiple times. The food is OK. They have good pizza and ok pasta and salads, but my customer service experiences have been terrible every single time and tonight was by far the worst. Every time I have gone, it has never taken less than 20 minutes to get my piece of pizza or small salad. Tonight I ordered an order of chicken fingers. 20 minutes after ordering I asked if my order went through. A server named Colby told me it was coming after checking with the kitchen. 20 minutes later (40 minutes past the order time) the food had never come and when I told an employee named kyle that I was still waiting for my order, he told me I was lying multiple times. It was entirely unacceptable considering how patient I had been. The experience has been entirely unpleasant and I would certainly not recommend it due to service and managment issues.",Rant,2
"Good, steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash, and while thorough, it slows up the line. No military discount, but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv, pinball, bowling game, Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However, they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently, the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally, they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable. For the $25 ""St. Charles"" wash, I'd like my rims to be washed and shining! Do not EVER go here for your auto needs.",Rant,2
"Had high expectations since it's always tough to snag a table. Unfortunately today's brunch was nothing spectacular...my chicken and waffles were terrible. My husband ordered the burger which was good, but outside of that, nothing blew us away. The seating is also really cramped...and the loud couple nearby watching videos on their phone was annoying to say the least.",Rant,2
"Last Friday we met two friends at Abel's Authentic Mexican Cuisine located in Verdi, NV. We enjoy Mexican food and really looked forward to trying out a new place we had never been to before. Overall the food was good. The salsa was fair. However, the service was a horrible disaster. When the waiter brought the wrong dish to my wife, he started arguing with her saying ""that is what you ordered!"" We (all four of us) told him that it was NOT what she ordered and he appeared angry, took the dish back and forcefully tossed/dropped it on a tray at the side of the table and stomped off. He brought back the correct order 10 minutes later; however, his behavior really ruined the experience. Very disappointing.",Rant,2
"Definitely not the best Goodwill that I've been to, but not terrible. Housewares section was a pretty decent size. I couldn't figure out for the life of me how women's clothing was organized except by what it was (not by size). Some prices were a bit expensive for what the item was, but generally reasonable. Infant/children's clothes were just kind of all tossed together and I had a hard time picking through. I would have preferred infant in one section and children's in another. Furniture was less than desirable. Overall, you have to do a bit of searching (but what fun is thifting if you didn't have to?!). Staff was friendly and I had a pleasant experience. Just needs a bit more organization.",Rant,2
"Long wait for mediocre food considering place was empty on a Sunday afternoon. Garlic shrimp flatbread was mostly bread with little tiny tasteless shrimp. Blackened shrimp and crab legs was just as bad. Crab legs still cold in places and got a whole four shrimp. Vegetable of the day was over cooked watery broccoli. The only good part was the black beans and rice. For $35 before tip, it was extremely disappointing since we drove from South Tampa. We will not return.",Rant,2
"They did a nice job renovating the place, but the service is awful. Worst of all, the pancakes were terrible - chewy and flavorless. Last time I'll come here.",Rant,2
"always have a good time whenever i go. i love the super spicy sauce at checked pig. if you plan on going go prepared. wear clothes you dont mind getting dirty, bring water, wetnaps, and bring your own beer too because it beats having to go buy it while you're waiting in line. it also helps if you take notes on the ribs and sauces that you've tried because of the amount of different stands.",Rant,2
"I want to start off with the fact that I've been here multiple times. The first time, everything was great, it was around lunch, the service was fantastic, the food was fantastic and I decided to make it my go to diner. The second time I brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla, when it came out it was just slices of cheese ONTOP of a folded tortilla, we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different. So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben's. One pastrami, one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don't always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked, and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked, chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he's facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out, didn't even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for ""Ashley"" to come get a beer for another server, instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least, the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip, which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table, which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I'd suggest my server find a job elsewhere, she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I'm even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers, bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I've ever seen in any restaurant! So to the lovely server with the bandana headband; GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! You're a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their company!",Rant,2
"The lady at the front desk was amazing, we got in at 3am and she found us a room. The problem I have is we were trying to get into our room when somebody walked out and said they worked there and said that's where he takes his breaks because ""nobody ever books this room."" This was very weird and uncomfortable, and then when we walked in the room smelled awful.",Rant,2
"Save your money go to El Rodeo across the street. I love mexican food, I was eager to try this place. It gets 2 start because the food was fast, edible and hot. Charged for sour cream..seriously? It's like going to Logan's and getting charged for steak sauce. Rice or beans on items instead both with meal. Charge for more chips and salsa...most have unlimted. Menu does not describe items unknown to others. Flavor of the beef was bland, no seasoning. Taco bell has better flavor and no charge for sour cream. I saw a staff member adjust his crotch. Manager had old stained food clothes. Table was dirty like they only cleaned what was seen...makes me wonder.",Rant,2
Service was great and egg platter was good but french toast was absolutely terrible. It was so tough you would barely cut it with a knife. I have never seen anything like it.. there was a small amount of egg on the very surface of bread.. they called it french toast but it was not,Rant,2

"Two years ago Florida Georgia Line came to town right around my birthday. Radio, TV and all over social media, all I saw was the concert. I figured it was impossible to not know about it, and I also figured my wife would be taking us to see the show for my birthday surprise. Sadly, I was wrong, and the show came and went, leaving me waiting for another opportunity to catch these guys live. Finally, that day came, and I took matters into my own hands this time! I scored a pre-sale code and bought two great seats, only to find out my wife would be out of town the night of the show. Lucky for me I had a great friend decide to join me for the show, and what a show it was! In addition to the sweet sounds of Cadillac 3 and Cole Swindell, who played all the hits, Florida Georgia Line brought the energy, the stage game, and every one of the songs you wanted to hear. But the best part had to be the two incredible surprises! In the second half of the show they walked down a catwalk to a second stage at the rear of the auditorium and played a set with Cole Swindell and Cadillac 3, including some homages to their country mentors, like ""Back At Mama's"" by Tim McGraw! This was trumped only by the encore, when they talked about the songs they identified with as kids and then performed them! Songs like Montell Jordan's ""This is how we do it"", Backstreet Boys ""Everybody"", Alan Jackson's ""Should Been A Cowboy"" and Papa Roach ""Last Resort"", and then they closed it all up with ""Cruise"". 3 Stars because of the insanely long wait for a bar. I think that's a shame. It's an event center. They should know how to do this by now. Otherwise the place is great. Solid sound, comfortable seats and clean.",Rant,2
"Unfortunately, I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.",Rant,2
"We came for my bachelorette party. A little bit pricey for Reno. We got 2 VIP tables which were fine - didn't have to wait in line which was nice. Service was pretty good. It's a nice looking club but the pool is a waste of space - there were 2 bay watch looking girls dancing in the pool - kind of weird. Bottle service was ok but a bit sneaky - they kept putting GSR bottled water on the table (the same ones you get free in the room - actually smaller) so we kept drinking them. Found out later that the bottled water wasn't included in our package and we were charged ridiculous prices for each one. If we had known, we would have just drank the carafe water. We had a good time (15 girls on a bachelorette party - kind of hard not to) but that kind of left a bad taste in our mouth. Also, I cut my toe while in the club and not one staff or security member could offer me any first aid assistance other than a dirty rag. I ended up hobbling out of the club and into a casino bathroom where a housekeeper found me a bandaid. I go to Reno and GSR often but probably won't visit LEX again.",Rant,2
"Sorry, no. Have visited twice, and those visits were months apart. Trip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not. Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce. Hubby had an average burger. We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip. Trip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player. Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud. Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing. This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all. Wrong. Big mistake. Horrible. Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful. And a HUGE slab. Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything. Gross. I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside. When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right? No, she did not. Hubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better. His steak fries were also good. We don't drink beer, and this is clearly a sports and beer lovers place. We tried, twice, and are done. No, thank you.",Rant,2
"I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it. Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again",Rant,2
"Fantastic breakfast spot. I went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times, but both times, the food was excellent. The first time, the line was 10 deep, and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order. It might have been because she kept screwing it up: My rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs.... the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on Sunday, they weren't serving hash browns, only grits.... I opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well... Great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal. Best practice, walk in to the back counter, order your meal and then grab a seat - no wait staff. They offer up great bloody mary's for those in need a little hair of the dog. I say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to. Unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of... even when still when your food comes out... Go and enjoy.",Rant,2
"Ok, the dinner was terrible. Just awful. I am not fond of tasteless fried chicken and nearly dry cornbread. The wine was OK. But the tour and the rest of the experience was amazing! The Steamboat offers dinner, jazz and an awesome cruise up and down the river with a fantastic overview of the history along the way. It was an informative and authentic experience worth the ticket. And while it was busy in our tour, there were still plenty of spaces to walk and sit and enjoy the view. And, as with everything else in New Orleans, you can take your drink with you. Oh! And the jazz music is live! And you can visit the engine room. Too cool! Do not forget a hat and sunscreen!",Rant,2
"This place is gross. The bathroom was dirty, with peeling paint and rusting fixtures. Old AC unit made horrible noises every time it shut off. The previous guests left some sort of food in the microwave, indicating that it had not been cleaned. The rates were low, but the Howard Johnson or Motel 6 next door couldn't possibly be worse. Not worth it, go somewhere else.",Rant,2
"U can skip this place. Terrible service and below average food. One review rates its as comparable to Zahav and other great places in Philly and thats the only reason we wanted to try this place. First we were 15min late and received a call to confirm our rez because as the hostess said ""we are holding your table"". When we arrived the place was almost empty. The waiter described the menu in detail (lots of details) and forgot to mention that they were out certain items and decided that it was ok to substitute those items in the dishes with pickled vegetables; also forgot to mention that for Aldine ""puffed quinoa"" means burned inedible charred quinoa. The food took forever to arrive and the waiter came too fast to take the plates/food away... Why hurry us when the place is almost empty?. I gave this place two starts because the cocktails were really good, but thats about it. I wont be coming back.",Rant,2
I was really excited to try this location since I grew up eating at the downtown location. I was horrible disappointed. The atmosphere is nice. It's a quaint little area but the quality of food that I received was far from what it used to be. I order Alfred penne pasta with chicken and the chicken was tough and the noodles where so far over cooked it wouldn't even stay on my fork. It slid right off in pieces. The Alfred was broken and oily. The Caesar salad I received with it was just an average caesar nothing to talk about. The garlic knots were hard. The wings I ordered were over cooked and unseasoned and dry. My husband ordered a calzone that was soggy and greasy. I'm truly sad and disappointed with this experience especially since the prices seem higher than the downtown location. I'll just hold on to my memories but I won't be back.,Rant,2
"Food: Terrible. We ordered the sashimi combo and the pieces were smaller than the size of a pinky. Everything is overpriced and when the sushi is falling apart you know there's something wrong here. Not surprisingly, the soup were served in small, cheap portions and the greens in our bentos were less that a forkful. Service: Very friendly and helpful. A couple beside us broke a glass and they cleaned it up with smiles on their faces. Good for them! Atmosphere: Professional, high class setting with casual shoppers coming in and out since it's the WEM we are speaking of! Overall: Never coming here again.",Rant,2
"I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar, because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift, because this one was not.",Rant,2
Worst service ever. After waiting 45 mins called and they say driver just left 20 mins late same story finally after almost 2 hours the wrong food shows up as well as everything disgusting.

"Arrived here early for our ghost tour, hoping to catch a bite to eat and a couple brews but was totally ignored by the bartender. So we ate elsewhere then returned. Took advantage of the ghost tour's 2 for 1 Hurricane special. $12 for the most disgusting sugar powdered alcoholic beverages I've ever tried. Ended up throwing them away and getting a couple beers. I would not seek this place out if it weren't for the ghost tour, which was great btw.",Rant,2
I usually don't write reviews of chains unless they are really great or really awful. This Cracker Barrel verged on the latter. I had gone there lusting after a chicken fried steak and this is what I got. It wasn't bad nor were the scrambled eggs. What did disappoint me were the grits and the gravy. The grits were gummy and the gravy was kind of like paste with a hint of chlorine. Things that should be easy to make but just not good. The biscuit wasn't bad but even it was a tad strange being more crispy than I would expect. Everything else was as good as you can expect in a chain but after this experience I think I'll keep on looking.,Rant,2
"HORRIBLE SERVICE and INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES. I created a Yelp account just to write about how horrible the service is at this Cosi. I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours. A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in? Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review, but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment. DO NOT GO HERE",Rant,2
When they make you bleed and rush the entire time you know they don't want your business. I get me nails done every 2 weeks and have never been in this much pain or had my nails be so crooked before.

"I invited 20 of my friends to Restaurant Week and we decided to go to Marmont. None of us had gone for dinner before so we had no idea what to expect. The first course was lobster bisque which was very filling and had a lot of meat and good flavor. Second course I chose the baked brie. It was absolutely delicious and probably my favorite course of the night. Third was the 12 oz NY Strip Steak. I had mine medium rare and it was perfect. Some folks were looking for the A-1 sauce, but for me, I had just what I needed. Another reviewer commented on the terrible mashed potatoes--agreed. Last was I chose the chocolate cake. It was difficult to eat (in the fridge too long?), so it sort of gave the meal a poor finish. The service was good. We had 2 servers accomodate us for the large party. They were very appreciative and worked well with us, and I will definitely be back. Oh, I had the mangotini as well (they have a very nice bar), but I could've used a LOT more liquor for the $8.50 price. We all had a great time and again, I'm a fan! Man that baked brie was amazing...",Rant,2
"My first visit. Like the ambiance. But a long wait for staff to find a missing chair for our table (after they had ""seated"" the four of us.) Awkward. Guacamole platter was great, but ceviche (recommended by the server) was terribly bland and non-descript (and mostly cabbage). The tacos were great, especially the handmade tortillas and the carne asada. Poblano cilantro rice sounded wonderful but turned out to be very meh. Calabacitas were awesome until I came upon a huge almost raw clove of garlic, a very bitter and unwelcome addition to the meal. Really?! Nothing too exciting on the dessert menu, so passed up that option. Service was decent, but they really need to pay better attention to keeping the drinks flowing. Fun ambience, some big hits and misses, and some service issues. Overall, good but could be much better.",Rant,2
I would give this place zero stars if I could. They advertise 2 paddle boards and all year only one paddle board and no paddle. Filthy conditions. When u contact front desk they say management will call u but they don't. Units are not clean when students move in. They allow animals. Configuration of the apartment is horrible. Like living in a cell block. Kitchen is too small. Not enough area for food prep or dish storage. They put on a good show when students are checking the place out but it is bait and switch. Don't rent here,Rant,2
"Would not recommend, the customer service is awful. Went for Sunday lunch only about 8 customers in the building, Took 15 minutes before they got our drink order. Ordered iced tea but they must've had a shortage of ice, the tea was cold but only few pieces of ice. Once we got drinks we placed appetizer and food order. Took only 55 minutes for our appetizer and food to show up at the same time. Only to find hair in the food. I made comment to employee about taking so long to for food and they replied ""well we only have two cooks"" then she waked away. Like its my problem that the appetizer and food took so long. While I sat and waited I started noticing how careless and rude the staff was yelling back and forth across kitchen, cooks yelling to employees that were sitting down eating at kitchen area. feminine male playing around thrusting his hips as if he was having sex with someone. I threw up in my mouth and lost my appetite at this point. I figured it was just a bad batch of employees until I walked outside and look back at the building and seen all the torn up American flags. The owner and management obviously just don't have respect for anything or anybody.",Rant,2
"I understand some of the comments below about wait times, but I personally did not deal with this at all. I mean, you have to give them some credit given it's an ""Emergency"" center. Same goes for the ER: sometimes there are long waits, especially on weekends and holidays. Anyways, my visit was awesome! I personally was not there for an emergency, but have been going to visit Dr. Cabrera for quite a while now. And as usual, it was as painless as could possibly be!",Rant,2

We choose this place yesterday but am not recommended to nobody.",Rant,2
Omg! Do not go here for food! I can not stress this enough. I began by ordering a coffee which they did not have brewed. They made a new batch and then informed me that they did not have milk or cream. She later admitted to me that they had milk but it expired a month ago They proceeded to stir whip cream into my coffee. It was awful and became curd-like within minutes. The pizza was just plain terrible. Cheese wasn't even melted and the dough was still moist. The service was also the worst I've had in Indiana. I literally got a look of disgust when I walked in and the girl was pissed off the entire time I was there. I wouldn't feed my dog from here. Beer only if you come here.,Rant,2
"I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received.",Rant,2
The cheese sticks were some of the best I've ever had. Deep dish sausage and pepperoni was pretty good. The wait however was horrid! We waited almost 2 hours! We were told the pizza takes 35-45 minutes to cook and then after asking when it would be ready an hour and a half later were told well it takes over an hour. Then our deep dish supreme was burnt and left a horrible after taste. The manager offered to make something new...didn't have another 2 hours. She did remove the burnt pizza from the ticket but that's it. We never even got our box for our leftovers that were worth taking home. Oh well. I do not recommend this place,Rant,2

"I went here a few weeks back. I'm new to the area and LOVE karaoke! It was during that terrible tropical storm time. I was surprised that anyone was there at all. The few people who did come out, were good singers and the small crowd was supportive. I didn't stay long, but I'm thinking about coming back again. The main issue I had was with the two drinks I ordered: a Washington apple and a whiskey sour. Those were the most watered down drinks I've ever had in my life! I was shocked and really didn't know what to say/do. I've never had such crappy drinks lacking in the alcohol department. What do you actually do in a situation like that? I'm probably going to go again (mainly for the karaoke), but I'll most likely just order something in a bottle. Those drinks deserve zero stars!",Rant,2
"The food was amazing! BUT, the service was terrible. After we received our food, we didn't see our waitress until we were done. We were the only ones there and she was nowhere to be found. We wanted to order more drinks, but was unable to. When we received our check, she threw/slammed the pen on the table. She was very rude. I don't think it was anything we did because the only interaction we had with her was when we ordered and received our food. I don't expect people to kiss the ground I walk on, but if you work in service, provide that pleasant service; not an attitude. Needless to say, we will not be going back.",Rant,2
"Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes, napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread",Rant,2
"Finally getting around to finishing this review... This summarizes our visit on the night of Gasparilla. This was, without a doubt, the absolute the worst service ever. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to be seated, we sat for 30 MORE minutes w no waitress visit. Once we actually did get served and placed our order, the food never came. When I walked up to the counter to check on the food.... the order was never put in. We were told to wait for 10 minutes 15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes. Once the food arrived, it was VERY good... but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the children's bed times at that point. Mind you, people who arrived after we were seated got their food, ate, and left before we even saw a slice of our order. Nice. Recently I read a story that Cappy's has pretty much barred kids from the joint, citing misbehavior. Well, given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to GET a pizza, this won't be an issue for me (although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait). While I am all for the supporting of local businesses (especially in the Seminole Heights area) and definitely see the appeal of a place like Cappy's (it is pretty cool inside, and had a nice vibe), my experience coupled with the anti-kids stuff I read pretty much sealed the deal for me. I won't be going back, with or without kids. Stephannos is right up the road, and they make a great pie without the drama.",Rant,2
"The boyfriend and I went to Samurai Sushi on a Friday night with high hopes as it is a place with 140 reviews that averaged 4 stars. We learned that Nashville doesn't have a really great sushi restaurant to put bring this very average restaurant back down to earth. We recently moved from Orlando so with our first paychecks we thought it'd be adorable to treat ourselves/celebrate new beginnings, etc etc etc. 6 rolls of sushi, a handful of sashimi, and about $70+ later, we were left with the overwhelming feeling of meeehhh. Firstly, the fish isn't all that fresh and the rolls are over-done. Whatever happened to just letting the integrity of the ingredients speak for itself? It's freaking sushi. You don't need to put 10 different things into a roll and then deep fry it and then cover it in eel sauce for it to be delicious. Some good quality fish and properly prepared rice is really all you need. Let the quality of the fish be the star of the roll and for the love of god stop deep frying everything. Generations of Japanese are rolling in their graves. And what is with this whole strawberry sushi craze? I thought I'd give it a shot based on Yelp recommendations and 2 weeks on, my stomach still churns at the memory. It's not that Samurai is the absolute worst sushi in Nashville (you can go to Ken's for that), it's just that the food as a whole is really really mehhh. I don't know if it's because TN has to source its fish from the coast and as a result all of its sushi restaurants suck or if its because Samurai just has a really cheap and therefore crappy fish supplier. Either way, we wont' be back to Samurai. Pros: 1. the place is cheap. 3 ""fancy"" rolls, 3 normal rolls, about 8 pieces of sashimi, and 2 beers was about $75ish with tip. 2. the restaurant is also cleaner than Ken's though that particular standard of cleanliness isn't really tough to beat. 3. most of the food isn't absolutely disgusting. Cons: 1. the rolls consist of more ingredients than a Papa John's supreme pizza 2. the fish isn't really like that fresh. 3. overall just very average food.",Rant,2
"I recently discovered that I'm gluten sensitive which makes eating anywhere else but home very difficult. For the most part I have sacrificed enjoying a meal out with family because eating something with even a risk of cross-contamination isn't worth it because I feel horrible afterward.

Yes, you can order breakfast and dinner at the same time of day and they were all very good! My husband doesn't have a gluten restriction and he loved everything as well.

"What a delightful find! We were on our way back home from a long afternoon walking tour of Longwood Gardens and decided to try a good old fashioned neighborhood crawl for one of those little Italian neighborhood restaurant gems for which South Philly is so well known. Tre Scalini came up number 1 on Yelp! based on our then current location and, despite that it was in a more commercially developed location than we were looking for (there were 3 othere restaurants in the same small block) I am extrememly glad we decided to go in anyway! We had no reservation and were dressed rather casually, and despite the fact that it was Saturday night and they were very busy and pretty booked up, the ma√Ætre d' was able to work us in with absolutely no waiting. Kudos to his efforts! Since others here have already reviewed the menu offerings, all I'm going to add is (dare I say?) if you're in the mood and it looks good on the menu, it will be. The atmosphere is Elegant South Philadelphia Italian, cozy, and warm. Our servers treated us like royalty, and were extremely attentive despite the fact that we were still in our rather natty sneakers. Each knew the menu and dinner specials inside out, no small task, I can assure you. Parking is tough in town, and if you just can't bring yourself to pay for the valet parking (it's only 8 bucks, for Pete's sake!), stick it out and don't stop searching until you find a spot - it's well worth the time and effort. And make sure you pay any parking fees - thePPA NEVER takes a break from writing tickets in this city because such a large amount of revenue is generated from the restaurant districts. I can't recommend Tre Scalini enough -- we couldn't have asked for a better meal or dining experience. Charles G. ""Chuck"" Boulais, CLU, MCP http://www.adultmedsupply.com",Ad,0
"I'm writing this review because somebody has to. Surrey's is allegedly the best breakfast in New Orleans. Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life. I don't understand, and I never will. I've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year, and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions, and they have all, to a man, in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know, ""Hey, have you ever eaten at Surrey's?"" They always reply, ""I hate that place. The food is awful."" I will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13. The emperor has no clothes.",Rant,2

Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer, wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this, you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed. I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise.",Rant,2
"On the banks of the river ... is the best pizza I have ever eaten, period. Its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments. A thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay (rather than delivering toppings in an after-thought, unremarkable, edible vessel). The perfect meal so far ... - VASI - Ceci Beans and Lentis (tomato scapece, grana padano) - ANTIPASTI - Aggrodolce Pork Ribs (green apple, pistachio) - LE PIZZE - Spicy Ham (coppa piccante, san marzano tomato) - DOLCI - Zeppole (blackberry yogurt, lemon curd) Honorable mentions and amazing seconds if you can manage ... - VASI - Cannelini Bean Aioli (smoked pepper, arugula, sicilian tuna) - ANTIPASTI - Carciofi Fritti (fried artichokes, lemon yogurt) - LE PIZZE - Quattro Formaggi (ricotta, scamorza, marinated tomato) - DOLCI - Cannoli (pistachio, lemon-ricotta, chocolate-olive oil).",Rant,2
"This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is ""Johnson"" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving, eat air. This place is terrible",Rant,2
"Ordered here three times now through Uber and the first time was amazing. The sausage and peppers pie was great and the pasta was tasty. The second time, the sausage and peppers pie was a lot thicker and not as good as the first time, but the steak sandwich was really good. There was lots of garlic and the red onion onion mayo gave it a nice bite. Today, I ordered that sandwiches again, and this time it was smothered in regular mayo. It was so disgusting, I threw it out. I wanted to like this place but it has no consistency.",Rant,2
Pretty good beer list but the service is terrible. Waited 15 minutes for a beer and then another 15 for check. Go across the street if you want a full meal and full service.,Rant,2
"I've gone back and forth with giving this place 4 or 5 stars, I am settling with 4 only because of the pain in the tail service we had when we first arrived. I was told by all my Philly friends that I had to go here for crab fries when I was town. Friday night during the Phillies game we went to Chickie's and Pete's, we were immediately seated at a two top table. While delivering our beers and crab fries, the server asked us if we were ready to order. We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was ""the whole game, well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table."" I totally understand her concern, and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game. A few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table, again, I understand her concern, but there is a time and a place. She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us, and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table, gross. While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there. Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us). At this point, our beers had been empty for 20 minutes. My friend went over to the bar, found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check. She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving, and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table. Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next. Now.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING. The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night. They were friendly, informative, suggested what yumminess to order on the menu! Over all, those 4 gentlemen negated the unfortunate experience on the other side of the restaurant. The food by the way... the crab fries... yum'tastic! My friend ordered the ""red"" mussels and I had the ""bleu"" mussels. I feel like we ate all night long and never put a dent in them. Absolutely amazing. If I am ever back in Philly... I will 100% be visiting the bar at Chickie's and Pete's!!",Rant,2
"If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",Rant,2

"I liked the place and food, but i cant give more than one star cause the service was terrible. They only have one server, her name is Gabriela. She was very rude with my guests and me. Plus the check came to $180 with 18% tip included and i explained i needed to charge a certain amount in cards and the rest in cash, i even wrote the amounts and card numbers on the ticket but after waiting a long time for her to bring the change she didnt bring any change and overcharged the cards. A total of $210 dlls instead of $180 she was charging more than $50dlls in tip. Thats an abuse. Im very very dissapointed and her only excuse was that she was too busy.",Rant,2
"Horrible customer service! Went into sprint explaining we didn't want a contract. Irvin assured us that they had a program that would fit what we are looking for. After having some issues with service, not receiving/sending text successfully and having the phones looked at with no success, as well as the fact you can't access data while on the phone hinders my productivity with work we opted to cancel service. We were told that with a lease all you would have to do is turn back in the phones at any time in good shape and you could cancel service. When we went to store they wanted $650 per line which totaled over $100 more than what the phone cost in order to break my ""contract"". They then said well your not on a contract you are just committed to the phone for 24 months and there is a ""option to buy fee"" you pay of you want to ""break your agreement"". I explained that isn't what was explained to us. On top of that our 3rd phone is on a totally different payment option of installments. So that is a totally separate fee for cancellation even though it's on the same family plan. These people are shady, and if you go to a corporate store they will basically call this store the red headed step child of sprint, and of course will take no accountability even though they told us our account was totally incorrect and illogical the way it was set up. So don't trust what they say they will lie just to get you to sign the contract and after 14 days you are stuck.",Rant,2
"Absolutely the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Everything was super greasy, salad was old and wilted and I spent more time picking out the rotten pieces of lettuce than I did attempting to eat it. The ranch dressing, honey mustard and ""roadhouse"" dipping sauce were all disgusting. The fries and chicken tenders were not only greasy but looked and tasted like someone's leftover lunch from yesterday that they over cooked in a microwave. Again, worst meal ever!",Rant,2
"I've decided to check this place out after a LONG wait at my regular nail salon. (also only 2 nail techs had me concerned, they work 6-7 days a week all day) anyway... I walked into queen nail and spa and was pleased, even though crowded, I still was waited on immediately. I was happy with the service. Gel nail lasted almost 3 weeks ( has lasted that long every time I've gotten them done at queen spa) the staff is always professional (today I got a pedi and eyebrow wax by Kim and she was SO nice) the only reason I didn't give 5 stars (like others concerns) is how they clean their tools. Is spraying alcohol on the tools efficient? hopefully i won't get some type of infection, if i never do it wont be a problem.",Rant,2
"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Indy. No, it's not perfect but it's great food, great service and a really cool dining room. The East Washington neighborhood is not great but not scary during the day. I love to pop over from downtown on my lunch hour for a great break from the chains, but I don't think I would bring my family here at night. It is a little pricey but not horrible for downtown. And you get what you pay for. Everything I've ordered has been fresh and yummy. Co-workers from South America say it's very authentic, too. I just know I like it!",Rant,2

"Truth be told IU West (formerly Clarian) is a lovely place with lovely facilities. Both of my children have been born here and the staff at the Women's Center was exemplary. This review concerns an incident shortly afer my 2nd child's birth for a hernia surgery my wife required after the aformentioned event. So, my wife schedules a hernia surgery with Tower Surgical, Dr. Andrew Nigh specifically, who has an office inside IU West. After a date was set we get a call a day later informing us that my wife needs to reschedule, it is for later in the day and this is an exception for a Friday, infering that they're doing us a favor and we need to be sure to be grateful. We arrive as scheduled and at registration we are informed that Dr. Nigh's surgery from earlier in the day has ran long and our appointment has been cancelled. They tried to call they say but my wife's phone was off. A day off of work has been wasted. Arrangements for care of my children, also wasted. My wife, meanwhile, is eating after being told she couldn't from 7am until after the surgery. (Surgery was scheduled at 430p) My wife immediatly calls the office to get the story and reschedule. Turns out that my wife was able to finagle a confession from a Stacey that no attempt to reach us was ever made (Her phone WAS on and even if it wasn't it would have gone to voicemail). Now, Mary Kay, evidently the only employee with the capacity to enter a name on an open appointment, was not in and we wern't able to reschedule until Monday. But, hey the good Doctor gets an early start to the weekend and apparently so did Mary Kay despite all of the schedule fixing needed. Dirty pool Dr. Nigh et. al. Dirty pool. You made the hospital that houses your operation (pun!) look second rate.",Rant,2

"If you want best in class customer service DO NOT COME HERE! I am sooo upset on how the management treated our situation. Travis the store manager and his team were extremely rude when we drove 60 miles last night to pick up BF's pre-ordered Destiny game. As a store director my BF was called in to work a night shift the same night of the midnight release - He was upset as he would be unable to pick up his preorder and accessories he wanted (big nerd I know) Me and my friend drove over to pick up the game with receipt in hand & gamestop card. However due to new policies we couldn't even pick up the game!? WHAT? since when is a receipt insufficient evidence to pick up a game. I was not as upset at the fact that new policy came in but the way we were treated was AWFUL! The whole team ganged up on us when we were attempting to figure out what we could do before driving back another 60 miles home. Not only was he pointing out in a very rude way that the pre-order had x amount of money down (in front of other clients) but he was rude enough to bring it up a second time in order to transfer the pre-order to another account. We left after we were ridiculed by the entire team led by Travis & I am attempting to get a hold of someone about this, even after my large Twitter rant which has gone no where! Customers want to be treated better! This was by far the WORST experience I have ever gone through!",Rant,2
"I really wanted to like this place. I went in knowing about the unique setup, but didn't account for two things: 1- how crowded it was - this concept only works if you have a sense that you're discovering something unique, not when you're colliding with sorority girls and food runners all night. 2- this is definitely not a place to eat dinner, particularly given #1. The food took forever, and when I went to find my own plates (we were sharing dishes) I was told that all the plates were dirty. On sum I think Bacchanal is an interesting concept, but they've outgrown it. Time to reinvent.",Rant,2
"Doesn't feel worth what I paid to stay here. The bed, sheets and pillows were wonderful, despite ours having stains on them. Complimentary breakfast is the same as pretty much any other low end hotel- waffle maker, toast, bagels, boiled eggs, apples, oranges, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, muffins and orange juice, water and coffee. The noise was awful! The people in the room next to us had no idea how to shut their door and had to slam it a few times to get it closed. If the sound of traffic lulls you to sleep in the mornings, this place is perfect! if not, a dog down the hall howling and barking at 6am should do the trick or the sounds of toilets flushing all around you. People were up and down the halls screaming last night and someone was in the parking lot outside our window having a party. Someone else reviewed on the thermostat and I have found the same true in my room, it says 69 but feels like 80. I sweate my ass off all night sleeping under just the sheets! This MOTEL is fine if you want to rest your head for the night and is SUPER close to Busch Gardens. I do have to say that the staff here was wonderful when we checked in and check in process didn't take but a minute and when I asked to go ahead and book it for another night ( before ai knew how awful it was going to be) she didn't hesitate to help and take care of it. Honestly the Wyndam is right next door and for two dollars more a night, you can get a much better deal! Also, do NOT order from any of the places brochures you find on te floor begin the door of your room! They are all AWFUL!!!! The number for Papa Johns pizza is on the key card, order from there!",Rant,2
Great Food... Terrible beer tap lines. All of the beer tap lines are dirty. They need to be cleaned. There is no other reason why every beer tastes like a IPA. A Pilsner tastes like an IPA there because the previous beer on that line was most likely an IPA. I get canned beer here... The food is great. Atmosphere is good. Staff is very accommodating and friendly.,Rant,2
"They've gotten a new wait staff so it might be under new management. The waitress I had was extremely rude. She seemed to be in charge because the other employees seemed to ask her questions. I always try a place twice before I decide on how I feel about it. Both times the same waitress was sneaky and rude. They had a deal 2 months ago if you spent $100 at Hmart then you get a free jajang myun. It was eat in only. The sign said you had 30 days from receipt date to get the meal. The sign was still up when I entered. When I showed the waitress the receipt she said the deal ended yesterday. I try to show her the sign but she had took the sign down. She says in Korean to the other waitress ""she saw the sign so I guess we'll honor the receipt"". I didn't let her know I understood. I went in again tonight. It was close to 3 pm. She gives us the lunch menu even though lunch is about to end. We saw in the Korean newspaper 7 meal options for $7.99 which is also limited to lunch time. We choose 2 meals and she says annoyed I better quickly put this in because the deal is about to end. I try to order from the lunch menu 2 items to go she tells me it's for eat in only. She snatches the lunch menu and walks away. Later she walks by so my mom tries to get her attention so we can order something to go she completely ignores her and walks away. She doesn't return to our table. We finally get her to come over to our table. We order a meal to go she says annoyed lunch deals are over it's dinner time now. My mom explains she wants it at dinner price so she puts the order in. She never brings our to go meal to our table. Another waitress brings us the receipt without us asking for it or explaining where our meal is. We ask her where it is and she doesn't know. My mom tries to get the nicer waitress over again after 10 minutes and we finally find out our meal was sent to the register area awhile ago. Worst service ever. Stay away. As long as your not trying to get any deals they have to honor you might get better service.",Rant,2
"Went here today and it was terrible. Sam is always character which is sometimes entertaining, and the lunch special is priced nicely- but thats the only good I have to say about this place. I ordered the california and nashville rolls (i wanted the spider roll but I guess he was out of crab, or didnt want to make it) and my friend got spicy tuna and something with shrimp. Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in, unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna, it was so hot, i almost threw up, started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad, i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order. It was a terrible experience all because sam didnt write any of the three seperate orders down that he took at the same time. I think i'd prefer to go to bar down Printer's Alley than back to sam's for a meal.",Rant,2

Not super friendly but the oysters made up for it. I was reading an article about the best oyster happy hours and we had decided to try the Blind Pelican too.

They serve Illy coffee & it is oh so yummy. Our breakfasts were prepared correctly and both were delicious. Presentation is superior. Our waiter & the owners were absolutely delightful. The only negative is the extremely long wait for our food. We were sort of prepared for it from reading other reviews but it was really way too long. We would return despite this",Rant,2
"The hotel relies on their location for business. Do not let their lower prices fool you, parking costs add up quick here( $135 for 4 days). The entire time we were here there was only ever one person working the desk, which is fine at 7:30 on a weeknight, but not during peak check in hours on a Friday. The wait to check in stretched out the door and took an hour to get to the front. Wasted vacation time. The close location to bourbon is good and bad- quick walk to many great bars and restaurants, but we witnessed a bum fight across the street. The homeless seem to congregate across the street and drink/sleep/heckle visitors. Not a horrible hotel but not a value in any respect.",Rant,2

My boyfriend ordered the carne asada he couldn't even cut through it with a steak knife (THAT WE HAD TO ASK FOR THREE TIMES!!!) Our waitress was sweet but young.... in an establishment like this if you are going for top notch service you need to TRAIN young and unexperienced servers. Its embarrassing when they have NO CLUE what the difference between a scotch or a bourbon is. Not only that but cant make any tequila recommendations..... YOU ARE A TEQUILA BAR.....How is this possible???!More training would be obviously helpful. Oh and might want to tell your servers not to tell their tables to write good reviews online and mention their names because the management PAYS them for every good review if their name is mentioned in the review! I get that you are desperate for good reviews because your restaurant is awful..... but maybe just FIX your issues....food, service, knowledge and then you wont have to have your servers ask people to write nice and possible fake reviews so they can get a couple dollars under the table. Work smarter not harder. A new GM would be an obvious great start!!",Rant,2
"I have had a complete horrible experience every time I've gone here. No one answers the phone, you are put on hold forever, no one seems to know what is going on with your car, it takes two weeks to get an appointment, they give you an estimated time that your car will be ready and then they never call you to tell you what is going on. You have to end up hunting them down to get any information. The first time I went there I waited for them to call me to tell me what was going on with my car, one day service turned into 4 day service and when I finally called to find out they said it had been ready a couple of days ago. The next time I went, still no one called me to tell me what was going on with the car, I called them, they said it would be ready by the end of the day and then it ended up taking a week. The customer service is awful. They did a diagnostic on my air conditioner and couldn't find out what was wrong, I had to bring it back 3 times because everytime it was still broken. I've been without air conditioning for 1 month now because of all the back and forth. I ended up spending so much money on a car that isn't worth it. I would consider buying a new car but there is no way I will buy a VW now from that dealer. I'm going to Pit Stop on Earhart from now on.",Rant,2

People went up to their table, but not many, because it's NOLA, we don't do that here unless it's the Saints. I waited till he was leaving and walked past our table to ask for a picture. He's awesome. The Sean Payton story overshadowed that we had absolutely terrible service that afternoon, but the manager comp'ed our meal, and every other time I've eaten here things have been great. BTW, for White Linen Night, the wife and I stopped here to get a couple of High Lifes to go. The bartender hooked us up, we walked out in less than 5 minutes, and the place was packed. Also, been to the upstairs part on an Abita pub crawl, nice space, never been back up there though.",Rant,2

I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary, I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size. The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit, but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway, half dressed, trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up. I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation.",Rant,2

"ONE OF THE BEST FOOD TRUCKS IN PHILADELPHIA! This is coming from a person that doesn't like trying to things, extremely picky, and not very daring... EVERYTHING on their menu is so good and filling! My favorites are veggie burger wrap which is $5 (instead of veggie burger, it'll be in a tortilla, but somehow 10x better) and chicken satay tacos (2 for $7). Their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too! Beware of the long lines though (try to avoid going anytime from 11:45-12:30, if you do, expect a long wait, and no you cannot call ahead and order). If you're a Drexel student, go in between class, guaranteed no line! CASH ONLY",Rant,2
Went on a Sunday night when bourbon st was dead...BBQ shrimp was the best I've had. Cajun shrimp Alfredo was very well seasoned and hit the spot! Bf got the gator burger and thought it was terrible(-1 star). Great decor.,Rant,2
"I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly, and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well, as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming). **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.** Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way. This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer. I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful. Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever. So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L. And, clearly, we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving, we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead!",Rant,2
"I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel. I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street! I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat, green beans, and chicken salad wrap. Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup, yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!! The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!!",Rant,2
"When I first walked in, it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here, it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel. It started peeling off in 3-4 days. My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also, the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin. I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something. Ewww. I am never going back!",Rant,2
"I really don't like giving out 1 star reviews when the food isn't completely terrible, but everything about this place is just so mediocre that I can't find a single reason why anyone should go here. There are so many better options for less money that I wouldn't suggest that anyone actually eat here because you would be wasting your time and money on bland food. Pros: The staff was friendly and the sriracha sauce for the fries was good. Cons: They got my order wrong and forgot the bacon, but I don't think even bacon could have saved this burger. Once I realized how much I had just paid for a burger and fries without bacon I was even less impressed with Bagger Dave's, if that's possible. The burger was flavorless. Not only are the portion sizes at the likes of Five Guys and Boogie Burger bigger, but I was amazed at how flavorless the meat was. I'm no chef, but I can cook a better burger with Wal-mart beef. The only thing I could really taste on the burger that stood out was the pumpkin BBQ sauce. I just can't get over how pathetic this burger was, especially given how much I paid for it. Words can't describe how let down and sad my taste buds were. The fries were a little overdone and also somewhat flavorless, which is probably why you get a cup of sauce to dip them in. They're definitely not on par with the likes of Penn Station or Five Guys when it comes to fries. Overall I was quite dissatisfied with my meal. I went in expecting some awesome new restaurant and all I got was something that doesn't even compare to Five Guys for a considerably higher price. I honestly can't think of one good reason to even try this restaurant. If you want a good burger go somewhere else.",Rant,2
"**EDIT** 7/12 I've since been and for sure have changed my opinion. Again, as I said below, I think I caught them on a bad day. 3rd time was a charm for me. IF I get a hankering for some good greek / med food... I'll check it out. Oh and to the reply from the vendor, no my first review wasn't a joke. My opinions still stand from my initial visit, HOWEVER since I went back i even tried Bubble Tea, for that alone... I'm a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE fan. Short and not sweet ... avoid this place. Maybe I just got them on a bad day... but suffice to say nothing was good. Sauce sucked, lettuce brown, long wait , expensive, and just dry and tasteless. Gyros should be savory and moist! sorry I won't be visiting again.",Rant,2
"Gotta love the dive bar scene! This was the second stop of our fateful Old City bar crawl and it was a pile of fun. There's not too much space downstairs and smoking is permitted, so keep those things in mind if you're with a big group. The bartenders were friendly though--they even gave our group a bunch of yummy cookies that were leftover from a party earlier. The upstairs is great. Complete with a jukebox and pool table, it's guaranteed to be a riot. Our group was the only one who discovered the second floor, so we had it all to ourselves. Much fun! My biggest complaint is the price. For a dive bar, they sure know how to rob you dry. Our round of vodka shots was comparable to what you might expect in Rittenhouse Square. Not cool. But if you stick with beer, it's not too terrible. All in all, I suggest coming here if you're already tipsy. It's pretty rough around the edges, but who doesn't love a classic Irish Pub?",Rant,2
"Service is horrible. The staff pop there head in and leave. No one to take an order. Came about 45 min early to make sure to order food. The front desk said to go in and there will be people to come take my order. But they just popped there head in and left. I was sitting front center ,so you couldn't miss me. Probably last time I'm coming here.",Rant,2
